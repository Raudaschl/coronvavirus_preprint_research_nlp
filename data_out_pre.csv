" New anti-AIDS treatments must be continually developed in order to overcome resistance mutations including those emerging in the newest therapeutic target, the viral integrase (IN). Multimerization of IN is functionally imperative and provides a forthcoming therapeutic target. Allosteric inhibitors of IN bind to non-catalytic sites and prevent correct multimerization not only restricting viral integration but also the assembly and maturation of viral particles. Here, we report an allosteric inhibitor peptide targeting an unexploited SH3-docking platform of retroviral IN. The crystal structure of the peptide in complex with the HIV-1 IN core domain reveals a steric interference that would inhibit conserved docking of SH3-containing domain with the core domain vital for IN multimerization, providing a template for the development of novel anti-IN allosteric inhibitors.",Multimerization of HIV-1 integrase hinges on conserved SH3-docking platforms
" Rationale: Several studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one. now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS. What This Study Adds to the Field: We compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one. author/funder.

" Summary Statement: DUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion. FSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene. This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4. 166 words. All rights reserved.

" A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.",Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
" Background 3 In silico bacterial, viral, and human truth datasets were generated to evaluate available metagenomics 4 algorithms. Sequenced datasets include background organisms, creating ambiguity in the true 5 source organism for each read. Bacterial and viral datasets were created with even and staggered 6 coverage to evaluate organism identification, read mapping, and gene identification capabilities of 7 available algorithms. These truth datasets are provided as a resource for the development and 8 refinement of metagenomic algorithms. Algorithm performance on these truth datasets can inform 9 decision makers on strengths and weaknesses of available algorithms and how the results may be best 10 leveraged for bacterial and viral organism identification and characterization. 11 12 Source organisms were selected to mirror communities described in the Human Microbiome Project as 13 well as the emerging pathogens listed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The 14 six in silico datasets were used to evaluate the performance of six leading metagenomics algorithms: 15 MetaScope, Kraken, LMAT, MetaPhlAn, MetaCV, and MetaPhyler. 16 Results Algorithms were evaluated on runtime, true positive organisms identified to the genus and species 19 levels, false positive organisms identified to genus and species level, read mapping, relative abundance 20 estimation, and gene calling.

" with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely . Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group.

" Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by .

" Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Dia gnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response. All rights reserved.

" International Concern following a cluster of associated neurological disorders and neonatal malformations. In 2017, Zika cases declined, but future incidence in LAC remains uncertain due to gaps in our understanding, considerable variation in surveillance and a lack of a comprehensive collation of data from affected countries. Methods Our analysis combines information on confirmed and suspected Zika cases across LAC countries and a spatio-temporal dynamic transmission model for ZIKV infection to determine key transmission parameters and projected incidence in 91 major cities within 35 countries. Seasonality was determined by spatio-temporal estimates of Aedes aegypti vector capacity. We used country and state-level data from 2015 to mid-2017 to infer key model parameters, country-specific disease reporting rates, and the 2018 projected incidence. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate parameter estimates to out-of-sample epidemic trajectories. There was limited transmission in 2015, but in 2016 and 2017 there was sufficient opportunity for wide-spread ZIKV transmission in most cities, resulting in the depletion of susceptible individuals. We predict that the highest number of cases in 2018 within some Brazilian States (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), Colombia and French Guiana, but the estimated number of cases were no more than a few hundred. Model estimates of the timing of the peak in incidence were correlated (p<0.05) with the reported peak in incidence. The reporting rate varied across countries, with lower reporting rates for those with only confirmed cases compared to those who reported both confirmed and suspected cases. The findings suggest that the ZIKV epidemic is by and large over, with incidence projected to be low in most cities in LAC in 2018. Local low levels of transmission are probable but the estimated rate of infection suggests that most cities have a population with high levels of herd immunity.",Projecting the end of the Zika virus epidemic in Latin America: a modelling analysis
" In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID-19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/τ grow =1/τ trans −1/τ inf , where τ grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, τ trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time τ inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(∞ ) ≈ 1− exp(− (R 0 − 1)/0.60) is the relation between p(∞ ), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time.

" Objective: The emerging and recent 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks rang the bell to call upon efforts from globe to assist resource-constrained countries to strengthen public health surveillance system for early response. Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. Methods: This was a mixed-method observational study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. Findings: The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (76.4%) but poor timeliness (41.5%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included lack of supervision, inadequate resources for training and difficulty to implement weekly report due to overwhelming paperwork at frontline health services. Conclusions: The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.",Title: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in Malawi: Implementation Gaps and Challenges for Timely Alert Submit journal: PLoS ONE
" The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from 2 China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

" The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 -164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R 2 =0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 -94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases .

" The condent high-throughput identication of small molecules remains one of the most challenging tasks in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. SIRIUS has become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectra, and shows outstanding performance for identifying the molecular formula of a query compound, being the rst step of structure identication. Nevertheless, the identication of both molecular formulas for large compounds above 500 Daltons and novel molecular formulas remains highly challenging. Here, we present ZODIAC, a network-based algorithm for the de novo estimation of molecular formulas. ZODIAC reranks SIRIUS' molecular formula candidates, combining fragmentation tree computation with Bayesian statistics using Gibbs sampling. Through careful algorithm engineering, ZODIAC's Gibbs sampling is very swift in practice. ZODIAC decreases incorrect annotations 16.2-fold on a challenging plant extract dataset with most compounds above 700 Dalton; we then show improvements on four additional, diverse datasets. Our analysis led to the discovery of compounds with novel molecular formulas such as C 24 H 47 BrNO 8 P which, as of today, is not present in any publicly available molecular structure databases. Metabolomics characterizes metabolites with high-throughput techniques. In the past decade, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) became widely adopted by the metabolomics community as a powerful and sensitive analytical platform, but yet only a fraction of the detected compounds can be eectively annotated, even partially. In untargeted LC-MS/MS experiments, thousands of metabolites can be detected and fragmented from a single biological sample. The measured fragmentation spectra (MS/MS spectra) are then used to examine the metabolite's structure. But condent high-throughput annotation of those MS/MS spectra remains highly challenging; this prevents the building of comprehensive knowledge in elds where metabolomics has become central, such as biomedical research, natural products drug discovery 1 , environmental science, and food science. Tandem mass spectrometry data is often searched against spectral libraries 2 ; unfortunately, spectral libraries are of limited size, in particular when it comes to biomolecules 3 . Although public spectral libraries are being expanded, only a fraction of acquired MS/MS spectra can be annotated by spectral library searches 1,46 . Computational methods have been developed that do not search in spectral libraries but rather in molecular structure databases 7 . Among these methods, CSI:FingerID 8 has repeatedly shown the . doi: bioRxiv preprint 2 Ludwig, Nothias, Dührkop, et al. best performance 912 . One reason for CSI:FingerID's improved performance is the integration of SIRIUS 10 , deducing the molecular formula of each query as the rst step of its analysis. Other tools lter candidates using the query precursor mass, reducing molecular formula annotation to a byproduct. This worsens identication rates 11 and can result in severe hidden prior problems 13,14 . Identifying the molecular formula is also the very rst step in structural elucidation using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or X-ray crystallography, guiding data interpretation based on atoms and unsaturation degree. The condent annotation of molecular formulas from mass spectrometry data is far from trivial, especially if executed de novo (without a structure database): Here, the number of candidate molecular formula grows rapidly with the compound size and elements beyond CHNOPS. To counter this growth, one can use heuristic constraints 15 or use only molecular formulas from some structure database 16,17 . Restricting the search space will improve the performance of a method in evaluation, but will prevent the discovery of novel molecular formulas in application. Arguably the best-performing computational method for molecular formula annotation is SIRIUS 4 10 , which combines isotope pattern matching 15,1823 and MS/MS fragmentation tree computation 22,2426 . SIRIUS reaches best-of-class performance without ltering or meta-scores 24 . But even SIRIUS has problems annotating molecular formula for compounds above 500 Da: Böcker & Dührkop 24 found that the percentage of correctly identied molecular formulas dropped substantially for larger masses. An alternative approach to annotate molecular formulas for a complete LC-MS run uses Gibbs sampling and Bayesian statistics, utilizing co-occurrence of molecular formulas diering by a predened set of biotransformations 2730 . Implicitly, these approaches try to identify molecular structures (or their isomers) from a restricted structure database, and cannot annotate novel molecular formulas. Network visualization approaches which connect compounds by hypothetical biotransformations and common chemical functional groups have been demonstrated to ease manual molecular formula annotation 31 . Independently, network-based methods were developed for structural elucidation and dereplication 1,32,33 . All of these approaches are based on the fact that compounds in an LC-MS run usually co-occur in a network of derivatives. We present ZODIAC (ZODIAC: Organic compound Determination by Integral Assignment of elemental Compositions) for condent, database-independent molecular formula annotation in LC-MS/MS data. ZODIAC takes advantage of the fact that an organism produces related metabolites that are derived from multiple, but limited, biosynthetic pathways. ZODIAC builds upon SIRIUS and uses, say, the top 50 molecular formula annotations from SIRIUS as candidates for one compound. ZODIAC then reranks molecular formula candidates using Bayesian statistics. Prior probabilities are derived from fragmentation tree similarity, which supports reciprocal plausibility within an LC-MS/MS dataset. On the theoretical side, we establish that nding an optimal solution to the resulting computational problem is non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard; to this end, we resort to Gibbs sampling. Using extensive algorithm engineering, Gibbs sampling running times were reduced to a practical level. To boost robustness, ZODIAC can integrate spectral library search hits. We show that ZODIAC improves molecular formula annotation on a diverse set of biological samples. Furthermore, ZODIAC scores allow us to rank molecular formula annotations by condence. ZODIAC is not limited to molecular formulas from some structure database, allowing us to discover novel molecular formulas not present in any structural databases. ZODIAC was evaluated on ve diverse datasets representing samples from plants, human plasma, marine microalgae and mice fecal sample, see Supplementary Table 1, 5 and 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6. Input mzML/mzXML les were processed with OpenMS 34 and low-quality MS/MS spectra .",ZODIAC: database-independent molecular formula annotation using Gibbs sampling reveals unknown small molecules

" Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.",Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation
" The outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread from Wuhan, China to multiple countries, causing staggering number of infections and deaths. A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.",Profiling the immune vulnerability landscape of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus
" The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside of China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January, 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

" The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.",Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV
" 20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link.

" Background. The clinical presentation of Novel Coronavirus (2019 infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.",Can routine laboratory tests discriminate 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonia?
" Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days-4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4-9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates. .

" Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4 -/mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis. Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.",Mucin 4 Protects Female Mice from Coronavirus Pathogenesis
" Over two-thirds of a century ago, Hodgkin and Huxley proposed the existence of voltage gated ion channels (VGIC) to carry Na + and K + ions across the cell membrane to create the nerve impulse, in response to depolarization of the membrane. The channels have multiple physiological roles, and play a central role in a wide variety of diseases when they malfunction. The first channel structure was found by MacKinnon and coworkers in 1998. Subsequently the structure of a number of VGIC was determined in the open (ion conducting) state. This type of channel consists of four voltage sensing domains (VSD), each formed from four transmembrane (TM) segments, plus a pore domain through which ions move. Understanding the gating mechanism (how the channel opens and closes) requires structures. One TM segment (S4) has an arginine in every third position, with one such segment per domain. It is usually assumed that these arginines are all ionized, and in the resting state are held toward the intracellular side of the membrane by voltage across the membrane. They are assumed to move outward (extracellular direction) when released by depolarization of this voltage, producing a capacitive gating current and opening the channel. We suggest alternate interpretations of the evidence that led to these models. Measured gating current is the total charge displacement of all atoms in the VSD; we propose that the prime, but not sole, contributor is proton motion, not displacement of the charges on the arginines of S4. It is known that the VSD can conduct protons. Quantum calculations on the K v 1.2 potassium channel VSD show how; the key is the amphoteric nature of the arginine side chain, which allows it to transfer a proton; this appears to be the first time the arginine side chain has had its amphoteric character considered. We have calculated one such proton transfer in detail: this proton starts from a tyrosine that can ionize, transferring to the NE of the third arginine on S4; that arginine's NH then transfers a proton to a glutamate. The backbone remains static. A mutation predicted to affect the proton transfer has been qualitatively confirmed experimentally, from the change in the gating current-voltage curve. The total charge displacement in going from a normal closed potential of -70 mV across the membrane to 0 mV (open), is calculated to be approximately consistent with measured values, although the error limits on the calculation require caution in interpretation.","The Role of Proton Transport in Gating Current in a Voltage Gated Ion Channel, as Shown by Quantum Calculations"
" During lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the gene expression landscape of a cell is remodeled to evade the immune response and create an environment favorable to viral replication. A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors. Furthermore, we showed that . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of target RNA susceptibility observed in cells. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human virus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. During viral replication, KSHV expresses an enzyme called SOX that cuts and inactivates the majority of cellular messenger RNAs, preventing their translation into proteins. Some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, while others are poorly cleaved, but the mechanistic basis underlying this selectivity has remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the efficiency of RNA cleavage is heavily impacted by RNA sequences proximal to the cleavage site, which serve as a SOX binding platform. This helps explain both the range of RNA cleavage efficiency observed in SOX-expressing cells as well as the sequence specificity underlying SOX targeting.",Classification: Biological Sciences Minor: Microbial Biology Site specific target binding controls RNA cleavage efficiency by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus endonuclease SOX
" Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ42), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .

Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic Aβ accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of Aβ deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that upon encountering different biological fluids, RSV accumulated extensive and distinct protein coronae compared to HSV-1 and synthetic liposomes. The various coronae were dependent on the biological fluid and exerted markedly different effects on RSV infectivity and capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Moreover, upon interaction with an amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP, RSV accelerated the process of amyloid aggregation via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation. This amyloid catalysis was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and the Aβ42 peptide in-vitro and in an AD animal model. Our findings highlight the importance of viral protein corona interactions for viral pathogenesis and provide a direct mechanistic link between viral and amyloid pathologies. Results Based on the extensive literature describing the significant role of corona factors in synthetic nanoparticle functionality, we used established techniques to answer questions regarding RSV pathogenicity 26 . Using proteomics, we assessed the RSV protein corona profiles in adult human plasma (HP), juvenile (6 months old infants tested RSV negative at the time of sample collection) human plasma (jHP), human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy adults, rhesus macaque plasma (MP), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). These biological fluids represent different microenvironments encountered by the virus in terms of tissue tropism (HP vs. BALF), zoonosis (MP) and culturing conditions (FBS). The biological fluids were screened for antibodies against RSV using ELISA, and both adult HP and BALF contained high levels of anti-RSV IgG antibodies, unlike jHP, MP and FBS (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Viral stocks were produced in serum-free conditions to prevent initial contamination with FBS proteins. Virions produced under serum-free conditions were incubated with 10% v/v solutions of different biological fluids. Controls included non-infected cell medium representing the background cellular secretome, and synthetic lipid vesicles of a size comparable to RSV (200 nm) with positively or negatively charged surfaces. In addition, we compared the coronae of RSV to HSV-1 to probe for differences between different viruses of relatively similar size. After incubation for 1 h at 37 ˚C, the virions were re-harvested by centrifugation and washed twice before performing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Six replicates from two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The detection of specific anti-RSV IgG antibodies in biological fluids was performed using Human Anti-Respiratory syncytial virus IgG ELISA Kit (ab108765, abcam®, Sweden), according to manufacturer's protocol. All biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml before performing the assay and results were compared to the positive, cutoff, and negative controls provided by the kit manufacturer. HEp-2 cells were seeded in maintenance medium until they reached 50-60% confluency. On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and medium was changed to VP-SFM with gentamycin. Before adding to the cells, sucrose cushion-concentrated RSV stocks were pre-incubated with different biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in VP-SFM with 10 mM sodium citrate for 1 h at 37 ˚C. The corona-precoated viruses were then added to the cells in serum-free conditions (diluted 10x) at a MOI of 1. 24h post-infection, the medium was changed back to growth medium and cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy 72h post-infection. After visualization, the cells were washed and stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, USA) for 30 min at 4 ˚C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS no calcium, no magnesium, ThermoFisher), then fixed and washed for flow cytometry using Cytofix/Cytoperm™ (BD, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then scraped and resuspended in DPBS, and the data was acquired using MACSQuant® Analyser 10 flowcytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Sweden). The data was analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar) by excluding the dead cells stained with far-red fluorescent dye and subsequent calculation of GFP positive cells within the viable cell population. For experiments with palivizumab, cells were treated with different concentrations of the antibody before infection. Human monocytes were negatively selected from buffy coats using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (1mL/10mL buffy coat; StemCell Technologies) and differentiated into moDC, using GM-CSF (250ng/mL; PeproTech) and IL-4 (6.5ng/mL; R&D Systems) for 6 days in 37°C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5x10 5 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 completed with 10% FCS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% and penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, USA). Immature moDC were exposed to RSV pre-incubated with different biological fluids for 4h in serum free media, washed and then incubated in serum containing medium for 72 h before analyses of CD86 and RSV-GFP expression. Dead cells were excluded using Live/Dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain kit (ThermoFisher). Flow cytometry sample data were acquired on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and the analysis was performed in FlowJo software (TreeStar).

" Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin are the most common known cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Multiple types of stress decrease parkin protein levels, an effect that may be relevant to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism(s) involved in this loss remain largely unclear. We sought to elucidate these mechanisms using a PD-relevant stressor, L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as toxic quinones via auto-oxidation. We find that L-DOPA causes parkin loss through both an oxidative stress-independent and an oxidative stress-dependent pathway. Characterization of the latter reveals that it requires both the kinase PINK1 and parkin's interaction with phosphorylated ubiquitin (phospho-Ub) and is mediated by proteasomal degradation. Surprisingly, mitochondrial parkin activity and autoubiquitination as well as mitophagy are not required for such loss. During stress induced by the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide or the metabolic uncoupler CCCP, parkin degradation also requires its association with phospho-Ub, indicating that this mechanism is broadly generalizable. As oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction and phospho-Ub levels are all elevated in PD patients, we suggest that these changes may lead to the loss of parkin expression in PD.",Stress-induced phospho-ubiquitin formation causes parkin degradation
" Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.",Significance of hydrophobic and charged sequence similarities in sodium-bile acid cotransporter and vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor

" The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.",Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus
" Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58, 956 [90% CI 40,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 -7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.",

" Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. ""Nowcast"" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission-that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases-and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to timevarying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package ""NobBS"") for widespread application. Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. However, approaches that seek to estimate cases in spite of reporting delays often do not consider the temporal relationship between cases during an outbreak, nor do they identify characteristics of robust approaches that generalize to a wide range of surveillance contexts with very different reporting delays. Here, we present a smooth Bayesian nowcasting approach that produces accurate estimates that capture the time evolution of the epidemic curve and outperform a previous approach in the literature. We assess the performance for two diseases to identify important features of the reporting delay distribution that contribute to the model's performance and robustness across surveillance settings.

The outcome of NP-cell interaction is dictated by the type and magnitude of the NP insult and the cellular response. Here, we have systematically studied the impact of minor differences in NP composition on cellular stress responses and viability by using highly similar poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) (PACA) particles. Surprisingly, PACA particles differing only in their alkyl side chains; butyl (PBCA), ethylbutyl (PEBCA), or octyl (POCA), respectively, induced different stress responses and modes of cell death in human cell lines. POCA particles induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. In contrast, PBCA and PEBCA particles induced lipid peroxidation by depletion of the main cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH), in a manner depending on the levels of the GSH precursor cystine, and transcription of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 regulated by ATF4 and Nrf2. Intriguingly, these particles activated the recently discovered cell death mechanism ferroptosis, which constitutes a promising alternative for targeting multidrug-resistant cancer stem-like cells. Of the two, PBCA was the strongest inducer. In summary, our findings highlight the cellular sensitivity to nanoparticle composition and have important implications for the choice of PACA monomer in therapeutical settings. author/funder.

" The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis.","Exploring diseases/traits and blood proteins causally related to expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of 2019-nCov: A Mendelian Randomization analysis"
" Because of the potential link between −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting and response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single molecule pulling experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces (f s) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As f and C are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the 3 -end hairpin (I F). Finally, the 5 -end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (E I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log Cm) α with α = 1 (0.5) for E I (I F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins. A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5 end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.",Salt Effects on the Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot under Tension
" Long-read sequencing technologies are invaluable for determining complex RNA transcript architectures but are error-prone. Numerous ""hybrid correction"" algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data. We have created a novel algorithm called TALC (Transcription Aware Long Read Correction) which models changes in RNA expression and isoform representation in a weighted De-Bruijn graph to correct long reads from transcriptome studies. We show that transcription aware correction by TALC improves the accuracy of the whole spectrum of downstream RNA-seq applications and is thus necessary for transcriptome analyses that use long read technology.",TALC: Transcription Aware Long Read Correction
" Ebolaviruses are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) within the order 19 Mononegavirales that possess the multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35), a major determinant 20 of virulence and pathogenesis that is indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune 21 evasion. VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses 22 such as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally 23 regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 24 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the 25 homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification 26 MS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of 27 Ser129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies 28 revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis 29 showed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory 30 activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies 31 demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral 32 polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT. Taken together, our findings 33 provide evidence that phosphorylation modulates VP35 function, supporting VP35 as a NNSV P 34 protein and providing a potentially valuable therapeutic target. 35 Importance 36 Ebola virus (EBOV) can cause severe disease in humans. The 2013-2016 West African 37 epidemic and the two recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the 38 urgent need for effective countermeasures, which remain lacking. A better understanding of 39 EBOV biology and the modulation of multifunctional viral proteins is desperately needed to 40 develop improved therapeutics. We provide evidence here that function of virion protein 35 41 (VP35) is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser129, a conserved residue among other 42 ebolavirus species. These findings shed light on EBOV biology and present a potential target for 43 broad acting anti-ebolavirus therapeutics. 44 45 46 47 48 49",Mutation of Ebola virus VP35 Ser129 uncouples interferon antagonist and replication functions

" In 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea, resulting from nosocomial transmission, and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-ofaddition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early-and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.",Screening of FDA-approved drugs using a MERS-CoV clinical isolate from South Korea identifies potential therapeutic options for COVID-19
" TRIM25 is a novel RNA-binding protein and a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response. Almost nothing is known about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. Here, we reveal that RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25's endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. Finally, we show that the RNAbinding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase function. These results reveal new insights into the molecular roles and characteristics of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases and demonstrate that RNA could be an essential factor for their biological functions. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Although TRIM25 has been generally well characterized, the functional importance of its RNA-binding activity remains unclear. Our recent study provided first clues: we have shown that the binding of TRIM25 to pre-let-7 leads to its more efficient Lin28a-mediated uridylation (Choudhury et al., 2014) . This finding raised the possibility that RNA processing may be spatially controlled through post-translational protein modifications by RNA-binding protein-modifying enzymes, such as TRIM25. Furthermore, TRIM25 could be using RNA as a scaffold to ubiquitinate its targets. Importantly, the transcriptome and proteome-wide targets of TRIM25 have not yet been identified. Finally, its RNA-binding domain has not been unequivocally described. Here, using data from a proteome-wide analysis of RNA-binding domains, RNA pull-downs and EMSA, we show that the PRY/SPRY domain of TRIM25 harbors its RNA-binding activity. Furthermore, TRIM25 CLIP-seq and quantitative SILAC-based coimmunoprecipitation assays reveal a comprehensive overview of interacting RNAs and proteins, respectively. Our CLIP-seq data identifies hundreds of coding and non-coding RNAs bound by TRIM25. We show that TRIM25 binds a distinct set of RNAs and prefers to bind sequences rich in G and C. We also demonstrate that TRIM25 associates with many RNA-binding proteins, thus suggesting it could play a role in regulating RNA metabolism. Crucially, we present evidence that the binding of TRIM25 to RNA is important for its ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself (autoubiquitination) and physiologically relevant target ZAP. Finally, by showing that the PRY/SPRY regions of other TRIM proteins rescue TRIM25's RNA-binding activity, we propose that TRIM25 represents a novel group of E3 ligases with RNA-binding activity that use PRY/SPRY as a novel RNA-binding domain. These results provide original insights into the RNA-mediated activities of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

" Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.",Single-cell Analysis of ACE2 Expression in Human Kidneys and Bladders Reveals a Potential Route of 2019-nCoV Infection
" The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.",

" The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.",Rapid colorimetric detection of COVID-19 coronavirus using a reverse tran- scriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) diagnostic plat- form: iLACO
" Rationale: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in infants and young children. The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data. Methods: Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified > 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used machine learning by random forest to derive protein features that could be used to deconvolve immune cell phenotypes in paediatric airway samples. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to identify airway-resident immune cell phenotypes that were differentially enriched by survival status and validated the findings using a large retrospective pneumonia cohort. We identified immune-cell phenotype classification features for 33 immune cell types. Eosinophil-associated features were significantly elevated in airway samples obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from >10,doi: bioRxiv preprint results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal pneumonia. Using a proteomics bioinformatics approach, we identify airway eosinophils as a critical factor for pneumonia survival in infants and young children. doi: bioRxiv preprint 1ml of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples obtained from children was centrifuged at 17,000xg for 7 minutes, after which 800 l of the supernatant was removed and discarded. The remaining 200µl were split into two aliquots of 100µl each. The first aliquot was used for neutrophil phenotyping assays and the other was used for neutrophil phagocytosis assays. 20µl of a pre-constituted cocktail of the following antibodies (from ThermoFisher) was used to label both aliquots -CD45, CD16, CD14, CD3, CD19, HLA-DR, CD66b, CD11b and a Live-dead marker. With the exception of the live/dead marker, all other antibodies were diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer. The live/dead marker was prepared at a 1:1000 dilution in FACS buffer. For the phagocytosis assay tube, 20 l of opsonised Escherichia coli (E.coli) was added to the tube (pHrodo Red E. coli BioParticles; ThermoFisher). The bacteria was initially prepared by mixing the E.coli strain with newborn calf sera followed by a 30-minute incubation at 37 o C. After this step, both tubes were incubated at 37 o C for 35 minutes. After the incubation, 20 l of a live-dead marker was added to each tube and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 o C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 l of 1X RBC lysis buffer followed by a 5-minute incubation. Cells in each tube were then spun down at 2,700xg for 1 minute and the supernatant discarded. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, after which 350 l of FACS flow was added. Cells were then analysed immediately on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument. The following gating strategy was used to detect airway-resident neutrophils: Debris were excluded on the basis of their forward (FSC-A) and side (SSC-A) scatter characteristics, doublets were excluded using FSC-A versus FSC-H and dead cells were excluded using the live-dead marker.",In-silico immune cell deconvolution of the airway proteomes of infants with pneumonia reveals a link between reduced airway eosinophils and an increased risk of mortality

" Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% -64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 -4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% -68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% -42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers .

Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 -4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore, which leads to 1.8 (95% CI 0.5 -3.4) undetected cases per detected case. The ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% -68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% -42%). : medRxiv preprint 7 In this paper, we have aimed to test two assumptions underlying the estimation of incidence at the epicentre of the SARS-Cov2 outbreak. The first of these is that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is 100% sensitive and specific across locations. While we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of perfect sensitivity. Based on our previous estimates 5 we assumed Singapore has the highest capacity of surveillance with respect to COVID-19. We regressed the cumulative cases against Wuhan-to-location air travel volume considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity and estimating the relative underdetection compared to Singapore in the remaining 190 locations classified according to the GHS 2 index 9 . While it is unlikely that this index reflects the true ranking of countries for any specific epidemic, such as the current one of COVID-19, we assume that it captures different levels of surveillance capacity. We therefore grouped the remaining locations into three big classes high, medium, and low surveillance capacity instead of using exact ranking. We estimated that detection of exported cases from Wuhan worldwide is 38% (95% HPDI 22%-64%) as sensitive as it has been in Singapore. Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travelers is at least 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 -4.4) times the number that has been detected. Equivalently, for each detected case there are at least 1.8 (95% CI 0.5-3.4) undetected cases. If the model is correct, this is an upper bound on the detection frequency because (1) Singapore's detection is probably not 100% efficient.

" To have epidemic potential, a pathogen must be able to spread in human populations, but of human-infective RNA viruses only a minority can do so. We investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 RNA virus genera. We identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds, a public health threat recently designated ""Disease X"". Humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans. This result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of RNA virus diversity in non-human hosts. author/funder.

" It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika virus, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine available. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. Very recently we identified two small molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode, with Ki values of 0.57 and 2.02 µM respective for p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate and qucertin. Here, by molecular docking, we show that although one is designed compound while another is a natural product, both molecules bind to the same pocket on the back of the substratebinding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Furthermore, as qucertin is abundant in many vegetables and fruits such caper, lovage, tea and red onion, our results should benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus. author/funder.

" A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible 31 for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan 1-4 . Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism-based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity 44 in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which 45 can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new 46 infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high-throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID-19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular 65 weight of COVID-19 virus M pro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, 66 consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its 67 enzymatic activity and to carry out high-throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed 68 a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled 69 substrate, MCA-AVLQ↓SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-70 cleavage sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent",Structure of M pro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors
" Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by onetime vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.",Getting to zero quickly in the 2019-nCov epidemic with vaccines or rapid testing

" It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-11 19) that can induce T cell and B cell -mediated immune responses. There is currently no vaccine to prevent 12 COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface 13 glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent 14 linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the 15 epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The immunogenicity of these epitopes was identified 16 using IFN-γ ELIspot assays. The IFN-γ producing T cell variation ranged from 11.1 ±1.2 SFU to 38.2 ± 2.1 17 SFU per 10 6 PBMCs. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached 18 to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the 19 proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated 20 immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular 21 docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.

" A discrete dynamic model for human epidemics was developed in present study. The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with transmission strength's decline and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. In a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. In addition, reducing the delay for hospitalization is much effective in weakening disease epidemic. Non-hospitalization recovery rate is of importance for enhancing immunity to recover from the disease.",A Generalized Discrete Dynamic Model for Human Epidemics

In the public data set, the percentage of men were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group, although age was comparable between men and women. Meaning: Male gender is a risk factor for worse outcome in patients with COVID independent of age and susceptibility. Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients.

" 23 BACKGROUND 24 The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute 25 respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 26 healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play 27 important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is 28 available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. 29 METHODS A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a 31 hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, 32 with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty 33 SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum 34 samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a 35 recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. 36 RESULTS Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in 39 .

" The African swine fever virus (ASFV) has severely influenced the swine industry of the world. Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs. author/funder.

" In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov"
" The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including location specific functions, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most tissue-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells. Methods Jejunum tissue segments were obtained from control piglets used for another study, following guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Wageningen University. Two 5-week-old piglets were used for generating organoids following procedures previously described [11, 13] . Briefly, a 2 cm section of the mid-jejunum was dissected and placed in ice-cold PBS. After opening the sections longitudinally, jejunum segments were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and villi removed by carefully scraping with a scalpel. Small sections of the mucosa were cut from the muscle layer, divided into small cubes, and transferred into ice-cold PBS containing 30 mM EDTA and incubated with rotation at room temperature for 15 min. The PBS -EDTA was then replaced and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing in ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), the crypts were dissociated by rigorous vortexing and passed through a 100 µm strainer into cold DMEM containing 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS, v/v). Crypts were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min, and suspended in Matrigel (Basement Membrane, Growth factor reduced, REF 356231, Corning, Bedford, MA, USA). To improve surface tension, empty 24-well plates were pre-incubated overnight at 37 °C. Matrigel containing crypts was then plated at 7 domes per well (approx. 35 µl per well) and inverted to polymerize at 37 °C. After polymerization, 600 µl F12 cell culture medium (Gibco) was added, supplemented with 100 μg/ml primocin (Invivogen), 10 mM HEPES (HyClone), 1 × B-27 (Gibco), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 50 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (R&D systems), 15 nM gastrin, 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 μM p38 MAPK inhibitor (Sigma), 600 nM TGFβ receptor inhibitor A83-01, and conditioned media for recombinant Noggin (15% v/v), Spondin (15% v/v), and Wnt3A (30% v/v) provided by dr. Kuo and Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht, the Netherlands). Organoids were passaged at a 1:5 ratio every 5 days using ice-cold DMEM by mechanical dissociation, centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min, and plating in fresh Matrigel matrix droplets as previously described [11] . Directly after crypt isolation, organoid cultures were separated into three batches per animal and grown independently for 17 passages. Jejunum organoids were grown for 3 and 12 weeks (4-17 passages) and extracted using ice-cold PBS. After washing twice in PBS, intact organoids were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and suspended in RLT lysis buffer and stored at -80°C prior to RNA isolation. Porcine jejunum epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 (ACC-701) was grown in DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) in 75 cm 2 culture flasks. Data for one IPEC-J2 transcriptome was kindly provided by dr. Richard Crooijmans, via the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG, BioSamples accession SAMEA4447551) [14] . For the analysis of the remaining two lines, IPEC-J2 at passage 87 and 91 were seeded at 5 x 10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown to confluence within 48h with reduced P/S (1%). The monolayers were subsequently left to differentiate for 5 days, lysed using RLT-buffer, and stored at -80 °C prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions including a 15 min on-column DNAse step. Preliminary tRNA concentrations, contamination and degradation were identified using Qubit (Thermo-Fisher) and gel-electrophoresis. The quantity and integrity of RNA was measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).",Congruence of location-specific transcriptional programs in intestinal organoids during long-term culture
" The novel coronavirus whose outbreak took place in December 2019 continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro). We compared and contrasted the Mpro for COVID-19 with a highly similar SARS protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the pocket's time-dependence indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors.",Molecular Dynamics Simulations Indicate the COVID-19 Mpro Is Not a Viable Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitors Design
" 300 words) 33 Quantification of aerosolized influenza virus is used for determining inhalation exposure. Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR.

" Strategies for containing an emerging infectious disease outbreak must be nonpharmaceutical when drugs or vaccines for the pathogen do not yet exist or are unavailable. The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.",TITLE Containing Emerging Epidemics: a Quantitative Comparison of Quarantine and Symptom Monitoring
" Drugs and drug delivery systems have to traverse multiple biological barriers to achieve therapeutic efficacy. In diseases of mucosal-associated tissues such as cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery of gene and drug therapies remains a significant challenge due to an abnormally concentrated viscoelastic mucus, which prevents ~99% of all drugs and particles from penetrating the mucus barrier and the underlying epithelia for effective therapy, resulting in decreased survival. We used combinatorial peptide-presenting phage libraries and nextgeneration sequencing to identify hydrophilic, close to net-neutral charged peptides that penetrate the mucus barrier ex vivo in sputum from CF patients with ~600-fold better penetration than a positively charged control. After mucus penetration, nanoparticles conjugated with our selected peptides successfully translocated into lung epithelial cells derived from CF patients and demonstrated up to three-fold improved cell uptake compared to non-modified carboxylated-and gold standard PEGylated-nanoparticles. The selected peptides act as surface chemistries with synergistic functions to significantly improve the ability of drug delivery systems to overcome the human mucosal barriers and provide efficient cellular internalization. Our screening strategy provides a biologically-based discovery assay that directly addresses transport through mucus and cell barriers and has the potential to advance drug and gene delivery to multiple mucosal barriers.",Title page • Title A combinatorial biomolecular strategy to identify peptides for improved transport across the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and the underlying epithelia • Author names and affiliations

Background: The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hubei and other areas are different. We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group.

" As of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy.

" Background: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is activated by proteases involved in allergy and triggers airway epithelial secretion and inflammation. PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells. Objective: We tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization. Methods: Endogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.",Altered polarization of PAR-2 signaling during airway epithelial remodeling

" Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China. medRxiv"
" Xylella fastidiosa is an insect-borne bacterium confined to the xylem vessels of plants. This plant 15 pathogen has a broad host range estimated to 560 plant species. Five subspecies of the pathogen with 16 different but overlapping host ranges have been described, but only three subspecies are widely 17 accepted, namely subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca. Initially limited to the Americas, Xf has 18 been detected in Europe since 2013. As management of X. fastidiosa outbreaks in Europe depends on 19 the identification of the subspecies, accurate determination of the subspecies in infected plants as early 20 as possible is of major interest. Thus, we developed various tetraplex and triplex qPCR assays for 21 Xylella fastidiosa detection and subspecies identification in planta in a single reaction. We designed 22 primers and probes using SkIf, a bioinformatics tool based on k-mers, to detect specific signatures of 23 the species and subspecies from a dataset of 58 genome sequences representative of X. fastidiosa 24 diversity. We tested the qPCR assays on 39 target and 30 non-target strains, as well as on 13 different 25 plant species spiked with strains of the different subspecies of X. fastidiosa, and on samples from 26 various environmental and inoculated host plants. Sensitivity of simplex assays was equal or slightly 27 better than the reference protocol on purified DNA. Tetraplex qPCR assays had the same sensitivity 28 than the reference protocol and allowed X. fastidiosa detection in all spiked matrices up to 10 3 cells.mL -29 1 . Moreover, mix infections of two to three subspecies could be detected in the same sample with 30 tetraplex assays. In environmental plant samples, the tetraplex qPCR assays allowed subspecies 31 identification when the current method based on multilocus sequence typing failed. The qPCR assays 32 described here are robust and modular tools that are efficient for differentiating X. fastidiosa subspecies 33 directly in plant samples. 34",Title: Novel tetraplex qPCR assays for simultaneous detection and identification of Xylella fastidiosa subspecies in plant tissues
" Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while casebased and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.",MERS-CoV spillover at the camel-human interface

" Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the ""seed cases"" from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054×x1+2.3455×x2 (n = 44, R 2 = 0.9330, P<10 -7 ). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% -48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

" Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA 20 virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host 22 were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we 23 compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes 24 were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease.",Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species 1 2
" Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4) , followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level. All rights reserved.

" Background: SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posing a large casualty. The features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, and laboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results: We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to conversion was 9.71 (95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/µL) of CD8 + T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019).

However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov M pro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS M pro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known M pro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

" Predictive models for the spatial spread of infectious diseases has received much attention in recent years as tools for the management of infectious diseas outbreaks. Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer's rank model, Fotheringham's competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer's rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets. The ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the 1 face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening 2 : bioRxiv preprint human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human 3 mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider 4 some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well 5 as some that allow for higher-order interactions. We trained the models using a 6 uniquely rich spatiotemporal data set on pre-vaccination measles in England and wales 7 (1944-65), which comprises more than a million records from 954 cities and towns. Likelihood rankings of the different models reveal strong evidence for higher-order 9 interactions in the form of competition among cities as destinations for travelers and, 10 thus, dilution of spatial transmission. The currently most commonly used so-called 11 'gravity' models were far from the best in capturing spatial disease dynamics. 12 42 movement patterns [13] including a recent incarnation as the 'radiation' model [14]. While these models have proved useful in their original applications, their use in 44 describing infectious disease spread is complicated by two considerations. First, spatial 45 interaction models predict bulk migration fluxes between population centers, but the 46 impact of these movements on the dynamics of infectious disease can depend strongly 47 not only on the magnitude, but also on the composition, of the migrant pool. In 48 particular, the extent to which migrants are more or less likely to be susceptible to 49 infection, or actually infected, than the general population can be critically important, 50 as can the age profile of the migrant pool, due to pronounced age-specific patterns of 51 behavior, susceptibility, and infectiousness [5, 7, 15] . Second, infectious disease dynamics 52 and Wales using a spatial hazards approach [18] .

" RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks.

" Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number R c , as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio R e (t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and R e (t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.",Risk estimation and prediction by modeling the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in mainland China excluding Hubei province
" Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS -two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).

" The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 which originated in Wuhan, China, constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level. We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.",The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study
" Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not 25 predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC 26 antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest 27 it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could 28 influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of 29 Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified 30 antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly 31 distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow 32 growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the 33 population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, 34 many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance 35 without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as 36 Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant 37 combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly 38 tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia 40 displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. 41 Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help 42 predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may 43 provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome 44 persistent clinical candidemia. 45 46 47 48 49 All rights reserved.

Some infections are recalcitrant to drug treatment due to 'resistance', which 52 refers to microbial growth in the presence of drug concentrations that inhibit susceptible 53 isolates 1,2 . Susceptibility is commonly measured as the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 54 after 24 h of growth in the presence of drug 3,4 . Fungal infections generally follow the ""90/60"" rule 55 for predicting therapeutic outcomes based on in vitro susceptibility testing: ~90% of susceptible 56 isolates and 60% of resistant isolates respond to therapy 5-9 . This implies that infection 57 outcomes are influenced by host factors as well as features of the pathogen that are not 58 reflected by the MIC 10,11 . In effect, organisms that cause persistent infections, defined as those 59 that are not cleared by a course of antifungal treatment, have similar susceptibilities to 60 organisms that are readily cleared by a course of antifungal treatment 12 . Accordingly, it is 61 important to identify measurable parameters that can contribute to disease severity. Only four classes of antifungals are currently in clinical use, and resistance to azoles, 63 including fluconazole (FLC), the most commonly administered antifungal against Candida 64 species, is an increasing problem. Altered drug uptake/drug efflux and changes in ergosterol 65 biosynthesis (the target for azole drugs) 13 are the major known mechanisms of azole resistance. Stress responses have been proposed as a third mechanism of antifungal resistance 14 . A 67 broad range of small molecules enhance antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo, with inhibitors of 68 Hsp90, calcineurin and TOR the most prominent among them 15-18 . Combination therapy using 69 antifungals together with such inhibitors has been proposed as a promising strategy to extend 70 the efficacy of current drugs [19][20][21][22][23][24]25,26,27 . In addition, several psychotherapeutic agents such as 71 fluoxetine, fluphenazine or sertraline can enhance FLC activity against fungal species 21,28-30 . Whether such adjuvants affect therapeutic outcomes remains to be addressed.

We posit that some responses to the drug are not captured 79 by measuring the MIC alone and that additional parameters could be used to predict the 80 likelihood that a clinical isolate might respond poorly to antifungal drugs. Furthermore, 81 understanding the mechanisms that underlie these parameters is critical for the development of 82 new therapeutic approaches against persistent Candida infections. 83 MIC measurements have been optimized to minimize or ignore residual fungal 84 growth 9,34,35 , termed 'tolerance' or 'trailing growth', which has been discussed in the literature for 85 over 20 years 36,37 and is detected in 25-60% of clinical isolates 4,10,19,38-44 . This recommendation 86 is based upon studies of acute infections using the mouse model of bloodstream candidiasis 45-87 47 , and the observation that isolates with high trailing growth in mucosal infections respond 88 positively to short term antifungal treatment, despite later recurrence of infection 48 . Trailing 89 growth is sensitive to environmental conditions, including pH, temperature and nutrients 3,49,50 90 and is usually detected in liquid cultures. Definitions of 'tolerance' vary and generally describe 91 survival or growth above inhibitory concentrations 2,10,28,38,51-56 , detected as slow growth within 92 the zone of inhibition using E-strips or disk diffusion assays 57,58 , or in broth microdilution 93 assays 38,39 . Tolerance can be affected by several adjuvant drugs 19-24 , iron levels 19,59 , genes 94 involved in vacuolar protein sorting 38,47 , as well as calcium flux 28,55,59-61 . However, the precise 95 relationship between the outcome of fungal infections and tolerance or trailing growth has not 96 been determined. Because tolerant cells continue to divide in the presence of antifungals, we 97 postulated that they contribute to the persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections. Here, we measured susceptibility and tolerance in a broad range of clinical isolates 99 spanning the major C. albicans clades 62-64 and asked how these parameters influence fungal 100 infection outcomes.

We 103 found that a range of adjuvant drugs, used in combination with FLC, increased drug cidality by 104 reducing FoG and not MIC and were effective both in vitro and in vivo at inhibiting strains with 105 high (and not low) FoG levels. Finally, highly tolerant isolates were associated with persistent 106 candidemia, suggesting that knowing the tolerance level of an infecting isolate may have 107 important clinical implications and may inform treatment options. 108 109 Results Tolerance measured as FoG is distinct from drug resistance. We quantified drug 111 responses in C. albicans isolates from different genetic backgrounds and types of infections 112 using diskImageR, a quantitative analysis tool that measures RAD, the radius of the zone of 113 inhibition, an indicator of susceptibility that relates to MIC 69,70 , and FoG, the fraction of growth 114 within the zone of inhibition, relative to the maximum possible growth 65 (Fig. 1a) . A screen of 115 219 clinical isolates (Supplementary Table 1 ) revealed that FoG levels ranged widely from 0.10 116 to 0.85 and did not correlate with RAD levels (Fig. 1b,c) , indicating that FoG and RAD measure 117 independent drug responses.

" in host-pathogen interactions. CASD1 has been described as a sialate-Oacetyltransferase and has been shown to be essential for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in some cell lines in vitro. In this study, we used knockout mice to confirm that CASD1 is indeed responsible for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in vivo. We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4 + T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, red blood cells from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on red blood cells was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development TER-119 + Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase, while TER-119 + Ery-C stage cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. These results suggest that throughout murine erythrocyte development, cells of the erythroid lineage express a glycoconjugate bearing a modified 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid, that is recognized specifically by the bovine coronavirus lectin and not by the influenza C hemagglutinin, and this modified sialic acid moiety is a component of the TER-119 epitope. As erythrocytes mature, the surface of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquires a distinct CASD1dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus that are specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid. esterases from Influenza C and bovine coronavirus, we demonstrate that the murine erythroid lineage-specific epitope recognized by the TER-119 monoclonal antibody is comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform that is completely lost in Casd1deficient mice. The 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform can be detected early in erythroid differentiation from the Ery-A and Ery-B stages onward. We also observed that a distinct 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety also decorates cells of the erythroid lineage from the Ery C stage onward including in mature red blood cells. RESULTS Prior in vitro studies have suggested that CASD1 is a sialic acid 9-O-acetyl transferase. To assess the function of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids in vivo, we generated Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1A) . The influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE) that is known to be specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid was expressed as an Fc-fusion protein (CHE-Fc) (Muchmore and Varki, 1987). Inactivation of the esterase domain of CHE-Fc with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) yields CHE-FcD which has been widely used as a specific probe of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Klein et al., 1994) . Using the CHE-FcD reagent, we evaluated the effect of Casd1 deficiency on sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in all hematopoietic lineages, focusing our analysis on the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Wild-type myeloid cells expressing CD11b exhibit robust levels of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid, but this carbohydrate modification was completely lost in splenic CD11b + myeloid cells from Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1B) . CD11b + cells in the bone marrow also express high levels of the mucin-like glycoprotein CD43, suggesting that much of the 9-.

Casd1 knock-in mice were generated at the BWH Transgenic Core facility. The resulting chimeric mice were crossed into C57BL/6NTac (Taconic) and interbred to homozygosity. They were then crossed into (B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J mice, (stock # 006054, Jackson Laboratory) to obtain the Casd1 tm1b null allele, which lacks exon 2 of Casd1. Excision of the neomycin expression cassette (Fig 1A) was confirmed by PCR. The following primers were used for genotyping. The wild-type allele was specifically amplified using TCCTCCCTCACTGTTCCTTC and AGGTGGGGAGGAAAGACAGT (291bp) and the Casd1 tm1b allele could be selectively amplified using TCCTCCCTCACTGTTCCTTC and GACAGCCAGTCACACAGCTT (5540bp). This allele was interbred to homozygosity to yield Casd1 tm1b/tm1b mice (referred to as Casd1-KO mice in the accompanying figures). The Casd1-deficient mice were viable and fertile. The Casd1 knockout colony was maintained by homozygous mating. Each experiment was performed at least twice on three mice each. Single cell suspensions were obtained from the blood, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus or bone marrow and flow cytometry analysis was performed using the following monoclonal (7G6) and CD16/CD32 (2.4G2).

One representative flow cytometry plot is shown for each condition. Influenza C hemagglutinin esterase (CHE) was recombinantly expressed as an Fcfusion protein and the esterase activity of CHE was inactivated with di-isofluoropropyl phosphate to generate the CHE-FcD reagent as previously described (Muchmore and Varki, 1987). Bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (Mebus strain, Uniprot accession number, P15776.1) was cloned into the pFUSE-mFc2a vector (Invivogen) into the EcoRI and BglII sites. A catalytically dead variant of BHE-Fc (BHE-S40A-Fc) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Fc-fusion proteins were expressed in 293T cells and affinity purified using protein G. The CHE-FcD probe recognizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acids, and the BHE-S40A-Fc virolectin can bind both 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-di-Oacetyl sialic acids (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016). Briefly, a two-step staining procedure with CHE-FcD as the primary and anti-human IgG1-PE (clone HP6017) as the secondary or with BHE-S40A-Fc as the primary and anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC (clone RMG2a-62) as the secondary antibody were used. To assess the effect of CHE or BHE on 9-O-acetyl sialic acids on murine erythrocytes, a 1:100 dilution of whole blood in PBS, was treated with 10μg/mL of CHE-Fc or BHE-Fc at 37°C for 1 hour. The cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature and stained with CHE-FcD as described above. Analysis of competitive binding between TER-119 and BHE-S40A-Fc was performed as follows. A 1:100 dilution of whole blood in PBS was incubated with varying concentrations of BHE-S40A-Fc at 37°C for one hour followed by the addition of 2 µg/mL of labeled TER-119 antibody for 10 minutes in the .

" Lung disease causes significant morbidity and mortality, and is exacerbated by environmental 24 injury, e.g. through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ozone (O3). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate 25 immune responses to injury by recognizing pathogen-or danger-associated molecular patterns. 26 TLR4, the prototypic receptor for LPS, also mediates inflammation after O3, triggered by 27 endogenous hyaluronan. Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the 28 flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to 29 environmental injury. Using in vivo animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O3, 30 hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the in vivo response to LPS, hyaluronan and O3. We 31 demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have 32 decreased inflammatory response to O3 exposure ex vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Using 33 primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases 34 TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Our results suggest an updated paradigm for 35 TLR4/TLR5 signaling. 36 Word count: 155 37 TLR, that modulates TLR4 signaling in response to its own ligands. TLR4-TLR5 interaction has 62 been reported once (19), wherein TLR4 was shown to promote nitric oxide production after 63 flagellin exposure. We therefore hypothesized that the reciprocal interaction may also be true, i.e. 64 TLR5 participates in TLR4 signaling after environmental lung injury. TLR5, the prototypic receptor 65 for bacterial flagellin, is expressed in alveolar macrophages (20), is induced after injury (21) and 66",TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and biases towards MyD88-dependent 1 signaling in environmental lung injury 2
" Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to 26 inhibit the replication of diverse RNA viruses, including arteriviruses and coronaviruses, which both 27 belong to the order Nidovirales. Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-28 of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA 29 synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus 30 (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence 31 of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the 32 arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or 33 A134V) led to a ~2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations 34 further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered 35 EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. 36 Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when 37 nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the 38 closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional 39 adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus 40 replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the 41 mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. 42 43 44 All rights reserved.

" COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with > 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using = 0.05. .

A 20ºC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days.

" Motivation: Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. Availability: The repository of this project will be published. There are two main approaches to predict protein structures: homology modeling and de novo structure prediction. They differ in such that homology modeling requires structural knowledge about a homologous protein for its prediction while de novo methods do not.

" Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 Å resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.",Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors
" Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.

" Adult honey bees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While 25 seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have 26 focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. 27 Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer 28 than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We 29 quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over two years 30 and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data shows that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and 32 winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest 33 community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift towards high levels of Bartonella and 34 Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee 35 experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in 36 bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is 37 remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees 38 for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter 39 bee health and disease. 40 41 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/703512 doi: bioRxiv preprint 42 The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator species for natural 43 ecosystems and agricultural production [1]. Its health status is threatened by numerous 44 factors including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and high parasite and pathogen loads [2-45 4]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota of adult honey bees plays a 46 critical role for bee health [5]. The bee microbiota converts dietary compounds [6, 7] and 47 produces short chain fatty acids [8] in the gut, enhances sucrose responsiveness of the host 48 [8], and stimulates the immune system [9, 10]. Moreover, disruption of the gut microbiota 49 composition by antibiotic treatment, pesticide exposure, or dietary manipulations has 50 been associated with increased pathogen loads resulting in increased host mortality [11-51 14]. 52 A striking feature of the honey bee gut microbiota is its low taxonomic complexity. In 53 worker bees, the community is dominated by less than ten phylotypes (i.e. clusters of 54 strains sharing ≥97% sequence identity in the 16S rRNA gene), which typically make up 55 >95% of the bacterial cells in the gut [5, 15-18]. These phylotypes have been consistently 56 detected in honey bees, regardless of geographic location, life stage, or season [16, 19, 20], 57 and are acquired horizontally through contact with nest mates and hive components [21]. 58 They include five core phylotypes (Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, Lactobacillus Firm-4 and 59 Firm-5, and Bifidobacterium), which are typically present in every adult worker bee, and a 60 number of non-core phylotypes, e.g. Frischella, Bartonella, Commensalibacter, or 61 Bombella, which are prevalent across colonies, but not necessarily present in every bee 62 [22]. Additional phylotypes have been detected, including Lactobacillus kunkeii, Serratia Page 4 of 44 marcescens and other Enterobacteriaceae, or Apibacter, but they typically account for a 64 relatively small proportion of the bee gut microbiota [23]. 65 While many of these phylotypes are consistently present in adult worker bees, their 66 abundance can vary across bees, and may differentially impact the host physiology. 67 Particularly, the type and amount of nutrients (i.e. pollen and nectar) available during the 68 foraging season can have profound effects on the composition of the gut microbiota and 69 may alter its metabolic activity [24]. Likewise, distinct dietary habits or variation in lifespan 70 of worker bees during summer and winter may influence gut microbiota composition. From 71 spring to autumn, young worker bees (nurses) stay inside the hive to take care of larvae, 72 and feed on nutrient-rich pollen, whereas older worker bees become foragers that feed on 73 nectar and honey to fuel their energy-expensive flights [25]. In late autumn, newly emerged 74 adult worker bees become winter bees (also called 'diutinus') that have an extended 75 lifespan (~6 months) and that ensure the colony survival during the cold winter season in 76 the absence of brood [26]. These bees form a tight cluster for thermoregulation inside the 77 hive, feed strictly on food stores (pollen, beebread, and honey) and retain their feces all 78 winter [27], which is likely to impact the ecology of their gut microbiota. 79 A number of studies have looked at the gut microbiota composition of different worker bee 80 types or throughout seasons, with the overall conclusion that the community composition 81 is relatively stable [19, 28-31]. However, previous studies were mostly based on 82 comparative analyses of relative community member abundance using 16S rRNA amplicon 83 sequencing. Such analysis cannot provide insights about the extent or directionality of 84 changes in taxa abundance, especially if microbial loads vary substantially between 85 samples [32]. In fact, a change in the total abundance of the microbiota could by itself be 86 . the single bee hive, each gut sample was placed in a drop of PBS, scored for the scab 132 phenotype [35], and placed in a bead beating tube containing ~150 mg of glass beads (0.75-133",Gut microbiota structure differs between honey
" Rhinoviruses (RVs) occur more frequently than other viruses and more often in people displaying symptoms than in those without. RVs exacerbate chronic airway disease and confound the clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness. We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to breakdown RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections by comprehensive molecular testing of a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001. RVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype ~90% of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were underrepresented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution. Notably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data. Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not the case. Nearly 80% of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect. For routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.","Genotypic diversity, circulation patterns, and co-detections among rhinoviruses in Queensland, 2001"

" Introduction: Cryptococcosis is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. It has high global morbidity and mortality among HIV patients and none-HIV carriers with 99% and 95% respectively. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of undesired toxicity profile of antifungal, multi-drug resistant organism, and the scarcity of FDA authorized vaccines, where the hallmark in the present days. This study was undertaken to design a reliable multi-epitope peptide vaccine against highly conserved immunodominant heat shock 70KDa protein of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii that covers a considerable digit of the world population through implementing computational vaccinology approach. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 Sequences of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii's heat shock 70KDa protein were retrieved from NCBI protein database. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the aforementioned protein at Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to discriminate the most promising Tcell and B-cell epitopes. Then the proposed epitopes were subjected to Population coverage analysis tool to compute global population's coverage. Finally, the projected epitopes were ranked based on their scores and binding modes through using Moe 2007 program.

" Health-care and public health professionals rely on accurate, real-time monitoring of infectious diseases for outbreak preparedness and response. Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are pathogen-specific. We describe a system, FilmArray ® Trend, for rapid disease 45 reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Results from a multiplex molecular diagnostic test are sent directly to a cloud database. www.syndromictrends.com presents these data in near real-time. Trend preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers. We summarize the respiratory pathogen results, for 20 organisms from 344,000 patient samples acquired as standard of care testing over the last four years from 20 clinical 50 laboratories in the United States. The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks and adenovirus and bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. Interestingly, the rate of pathogen co-detections, on average 7.7%, matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. 55 All rights reserved.

" The ability to comprehensively characterize exposures and immune responses to viral infections will be critical to better understanding human health and disease. We previously described the VirScan system, a phage-display based technology for profiling antibody binding to a comprehensive library of peptides designed to represent the human virome. The previous VirScan analytical approach did not fully account for disproportionate representation of viruses in the library or for antibody cross-reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses. Here we present the 'AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm' ('AVARDA'), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDA's utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDA's conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection. AVARDA, in combination with VirScan and other pan-pathogen serological techniques, is likely to find broad utility in the epidemiology and diagnosis of infectious diseases. All rights reserved.

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38 for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Estimating infectious disease parameters such as the serial interval (time between symptom onset in primary and secondary cases) and reproductive number (average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case) are important to understand infectious disease dynamics. Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. In simulations we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany. All rights reserved.

" Most fungal viruses have been identified in plant pathogens, whereas the presence of viral 33 particles in human pathogenic fungi is less well studied. In the present study, we observed 34 extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of 35 Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface, 36 and species in this group are considered to be etiological factors in various skin diseases 37 including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA 38 segments and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the 39 Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel 40 protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-41 free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were 42 down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were 43 increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly 44 larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection 45 dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic 46 acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-47 derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to 48 the pathogenesis of Malassezia. Importance 51 Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is associated 52 with various skin diseases including dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Among Malassezia 53 species, M. restricta is the most widely observed species on the human skin. In the current 54 study, we identified a novel dsRNA virus, named MrV40, in M. restricta and characterized 55 the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with an independent satellite dsRNA 56 viral segment. Moreover, we found altered expression of genes involved in ribosomal 57 synthesis and programmed cell death, indicating that virus infection altered the physiology of 58 the fungal host cells. Our data also showed that the viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a 59 TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells 60 (BMDCs), indicating that a viral element likely contributes to the pathogenesis of Malassezia. 61 This is the first study to identify and characterize a novel mycovirus in Malassezia. : bioRxiv preprint 65 mushrooms (1). Fungal viruses, also known as mycoviruses, possess different forms of viral 66 genomes including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and 67 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It is estimated that 30-80% of all fungal species, mainly 68 endophytic fungi, are infected with viruses. Unlike viruses that infect other organisms, the 69 transmission of fungal virus occurs vertically by cell division or horizontally via mating or 70 hyphal anastomosis, with no extracellular phase of the virus life cycle. dsRNA segments have 71 predominantly been found for fungal viruses and, taxonomically, the fungal dsRNA viruses 72 are classified into seven families: Chrysoviridae, Endornaviridae, Megabirnaviridae, 73 Quadriviridae, Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, and Totiviridae (2). 74 The model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae also carries a dsRNA virus that belongs to the 75 Totiviridae family and is known as the L-A virus. A unique feature of fungal viruses of the 76 Totiviridae family is their capability to produce the killer toxin that lyses susceptible neighbor 77 strains, whereas the virus-containing strain (also known as a killer strain) is immune to the 78 toxin. Studies of how the virus produces killer toxins in S. cerevisiae showed that killer toxins 79 are encoded by a satellite dsRNA segment, known as the M satellite, within the L-A virus. To 80 date, four different killer toxins, K1, K2, K28, and Klus have been described (3-6). The S. 81 cerevisiae L-A virus forms icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 39 nm (7). 82 The virus possesses a non-segmented 4.6-kb dsRNA genome consisting of two open reading 83 frames (ORFs), gag and pol, which overlap by 130 base pairs (bp) (8). gag encodes a major 84 76-kDa capsid protein (CP), and a 180-kDa minor protein species is encoded as a Gag-Pol : bioRxiv preprint 6 fusion protein possesses viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity (8). The 87 ribosomal frameshift is an interesting feature in a compact viral genome and has been 88 commonly found in various viral genomes as a mechanism to allow viruses to express 89 overlapping ORFs. Studies of S. cerevisiae L-A virus revealed that the mechanism of 90 frameshifting is based on the sequence structures including a canonical slippery heptamer, 5′-91 X XXY YYZ-3′ (X= A, U or G; Y=A or U; Z=A, U, or C) and RNA pseudoknot (11). 92 Fungal viruses have also been considered as biocontrol agents in the field of agriculture. For 93 example, a virus causes hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica 94 (12, 13), and a virus mediates the biocontrol of other phytopathogenic fungi such as 95 Helminthosporium victoriae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Botrytis cinerea (14). 96 Although viral infections in fungal cells are widespread, the interactions between the fungal 97 virus and its host are not well understood. One of the most studied host defense mechanisms 98 is RNA silencing. Several studies have shown that RNA silencing functions as an antiviral 99 defense mechanism against C. parasitica in fungi. Disruption of the dicer pathway in C. 100 parasitica increases the susceptibility to virus infections (15), and p29 was identified as a 101 suppressor that inhibits expression of the genes required for RNA silencing-mediated viral 102 defense in the fungus (16). Similarly, conserved RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defense 103 systems have been identified in Aspergillus nidulans, Rosellinia necatrix, and Fusarium 104 graminearum (17-19). 105 Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is considered as 106 an etiological factor in various skin diseases including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and 107 atopic dermatitis (20-23). Eighteen Malassezia species have been identified; among them, M. 108 restricta is the most abundant on the human skin (20). Recent studies showed an increased : bioRxiv preprint 7 burden of M. restricta on the scalp of patients with dandruff, indicating an association 110 between dandruff and the fungus although its role as a pathogenic organism is still unclear, 111 and the host susceptibility should be taken into consideration (21, 24-27). Most fungal viruses 112 are found in plant pathogenic fungi, whereas few examples of viral particles have been 113 identified in human pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans (28). In the present study, we 114 observed extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in various M. restricta clinical isolates which 115 represented a novel viral genome and its satellite. Sequence analysis revealed that the virus 116 belongs to the Totiviridae family and that the additional satellite dsRNA segment encodes a 117 novel protein. The interactions between the viral elements and the fungal host, and the impact 118 of the virus on fungal interactions with immune cells were evaluated. 119 120 Results 121 Identification of extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in Malassezia 122 Extrachromosomal nucleic acid bands were observed in total nucleic acid extracts of the M. 123 restricta strains isolated in our recent study (29). Among the strains, M. restricta KCTC 124 27540 was used to identify extrachromosomal segments. Total nucleic acids were extracted 125 from the strain and digested with DNase I, RNase A, and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal 126 segments and ribosomal RNA were resistant to DNase I, indicating that they were neither 127 ssDNA nor dsDNA. RNase A degraded all nucleic acids except for genomic DNA, whereas 128 RNase T1, which catalyzes the degradation of ssRNA, removed ribosomal RNA only (30). 129 These results suggested that the extrachromosomal segments correspond to dsRNA, and that 130 M. restricta KCTC 27540 possesses two separate extrachromosomal segments estimated by 131 agarose gel electrophoresis to be approximately 4.5 and 1.5 kb (Fig. 1A). : bioRxiv preprint 8 To confirm whether the extrachromosomal segments observed in other M. restricta clinical 133 isolates were also dsRNA, total nucleic acid extracts from the strains other than M. restricta 134 KCTC 27540 were treated with DNAse I and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal segments 135 remained unaffected after enzyme treatment, indicating that they are also dsRNA, as in M. 136 restricta KCTC 27540 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, other Malassezia species including M. globosa, 137 M. pachydermatis, and M sympodialis showed similar extrachromosomal dsRNA segments 138 suggesting that these segments are common characteristics of Malassezia species (Fig. 1C). 139 Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed extrachromosomal segments composed of at least two 140 separate dsRNA fragments except for M. restricta KCTC 27543, which showed a single 141 dsRNA fragment. Additionally, the large fragments of dsRNA showed similar sizes (~5.0 kb), 142 whereas the small dsRNA segments varied in size in different strains ( Fig. 1B and 1C) . We 143 hypothesized that the dsRNA segments from Malassezia strains represent the dsRNA 144 elements of mycoviruses, which are prevalent in all major fungal taxa (2). Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was conducted to purify virus particles to confirm that 146 the dsRNA segments in the Malassezia strains were indeed viral elements. The separated 147 nucleic acids and proteins in each fraction were analyzed. Two dsRNA fragments (~5.0 and 148 ~1.7 kb) were clearly visible in fractions 1-6 following agarose gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-150 PAGE) showed that fractions 3-6 contained protein bands with an estimated molecular 151 weight of ~77 kDa (Fig. 2B ). This molecular weight is similar to that of the known capsid 152 protein of the S. cerevisiae mycovirus (9, 31, 32). Fractions 3-6 were subsequently evaluated 153 by microscopy to visualize mycovirus particles in M. restricta. Transmission electron 154 microscopy (TEM) images showed virus-like particles with an isometric shape and a : bioRxiv preprint 157 the viral particle as MrV40 (M. restricta KCTC 27540 Mycovirus). The large and small 158 dsRNA viral fragments were named as MrV40L and MrV40S, respectively. In addition to 159 evaluating images of the purified virus particle, we examined the morphology of M. restricta 160 KCTC27540 cells containing the mycovirus for comparison with virus-free cells of M. 161 restricta KCTC 27527 by TEM. The results showed that, in general, the size of vacuoles in 162 the virus-containing strain was significantly larger than those in the virus-free strain, 163 suggesting that the virus influences vacuole size in M. restricta (Fig. 3). 164 165 Determination of dsRNA sequence of MrV40L 166 The complete sequence of MrV40L was determined by a combination of the Illumina MiSeq 167 technique and the Sanger sequencing method using purified viral dsRNA. The length of the 168 complete assembled sequence of MrV40L was 4,606 bp, and two overlapping open reading 169 frames (ORFs), designated as ORF1 and ORF2, were identified (Fig. 4A). ORF1 corresponds 170 to the region from nucleotides (nt) 28 to 2,097 and encodes a polypeptide of 689 amino acids 171 with a molecular weight of 77 kDa. ORF2 corresponds to the region from nt 1,949 to 4,538 172 and encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids with a molecular weight of 98 kDa. The results 173 of BLAST analysis showed that the protein sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 were highly 174 similar to the capsid protein (CP; the Pfam families of LA-virus_coat, PF09220) and viral 175 RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDRP; the Pfam family of RDRP_4, PF02123) of S. 176 segobiensis virus L belonging to the genus Totivirus (Totiviridae family) with 53% 177 (YP_009507830.1) and 52% (YP_009507831.1) identities, respectively (33). Eight conserved : bioRxiv preprint 189 genomes similar to MrV40Ls, while the remaining samples had dissimilar viral genomes (Fig. 190 5B). 191 Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic classification of the same viruses found in other 192 clinical M. restricta isolates by multilocus sequence typing of the 1,075-bp region, 638 bp of 193 ORF1, and 437 bp of ORF2, corresponding to gag and pol, respectively, within the viral 194 genomes. The results revealed that the viruses were classified into three clades: clade Ⅰ 195 (MrV12L, MrV16L, MrV40L, MrV79L, MrV80L, and MrV82L), clade Ⅱ (MrV18L, 196 MrV43L, MrV83L, and MrV50L), and clade Ⅲ (MrV24L) (Fig. 5C). Additionally, the 197 sequences of the 1,075-bp region of MrV40L, MrV79L, and MrV82L in the clade I were 100% 198 identical, suggesting that they originated from the same lineage. : bioRxiv preprint To determine the sequence of MrV40S, the dsRNA segments of MrV40S were extracted from 202 agarose gels and then subjected to cDNA cloning and sequencing (See Materials and 203 Methods). Using the partial sequences obtained from cDNA clones and the sequences 204 obtained from repeated 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we successfully 205 determined the complete sequence of MrV40S. The sequence of MrV40S was 1,355 bp, and 206 a single ORF was identified in the 3′ region (from nt 773 to 1,097) which encoded a 207 polypeptide of 124 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa. The ORF was 208 designated as ORF3. Although we obtained the complete sequence of MrV40S, no 209 homologous protein sequence was identified by BLAST analysis using all currently available 210 databases. 211 Mycoviruses belonging to totivirus, particularly the S. cerevisiae LA-virus, often possess a 212 satellite dsRNA segment known as M dsRNA, which is responsible for producing a killer 213 toxin that excludes neighboring yeast cells. Because MrV40L resembles M dsRNA, we 214 predicted that MrV40S produces a protein that inhibits other Malassezia strains and/or other 215 fungal and/or bacterial cells residing on the skin. To test the toxin-like activity of the protein 216 produced from MrV40S, ORF3 was cloned and the protein was heterologously expressed in 217 Escherichia coli and purified (Fig. 6A). The activity of the purified protein was evaluated 218 against several pathogenic fungi and bacteria including M. restricta, C. albicans, 219 Cryptococcus neoformans, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Unexpectedly, the purified 220 protein displayed no growth inhibitory effect on the microbial cells tested (data not shown). Based on these results, we concluded that the novel protein produced from ORF3 likely has 222 no toxin-like activity against the microorganisms tested, and further functional studies are 223 required to characterize its function. : bioRxiv preprint Notably, small increases in the production of TNF-α and IFN-α in TLR3 knockout mice in 318 response to the cell extract of virus-infected M. restricta KCTC 27540 were ignored in our 319 results because only one sample among the two virus-infected strains displayed an increase. The change in IL-10 in the same mutant BMDCs was also excluded because the differences 321 were statistically insignificant. Overall, our data suggest that dsRNA in MrV40 triggers an 322 increase in the production of cytokines involved in inflammation and that TLR3 plays a 323 central role in the host response. 324 325 Discussion 326 In the current study, we detected dsRNA virus in several clinical isolates of Malassezia 327 species. Among them, MrV40 identified in M. restricta KCTC 27540 was selected, and its 328 genome structure, effects on host gene expression, and influence on the mammalian immune 329 response were evaluated. Our data showed that MrV40 consists of two RNA segments, which 330 we named as MrV40L and MrV40S. The results of genome sequence analysis suggested that 331 these segments were 4,606 and 1,355 bp, respectively, and belong to the totivirus. Typically, 332 the genomes of the viruses belonging to the genus Totivirus consist of non-segmented dsRNA 333 with sizes between 4.6 and 7.0 kb, and contain two ORFs, gag and pol. Studies have 334 specifically examined the genome structure of Totivirus because of the overlapping nature of 335 the two ORFs, where a -1 frameshift occurs, resulting translation of the fusion protein (2). The overlapping ORFs and frameshift were frequently observed in a compact viral genome to 337 translate proteins and were found in several dsRNA and ssRNA viruses; these ORFs allow 338 ribosomes to translate CP and RDRP continuously with a missing CP termination codon (11, : bioRxiv preprint 17 the pseudoknot structure of the mRNA for efficient slipping via a slippery site (57). For 341 example, in the genome of the S. cerevisiae L-A virus, the 5′ ORF (gag) encodes a 76-kDa 342 CP and the 3′ ORF (pol) encodes an RDRP which is expressed as a 180-kDa CP-RDRP 343 fusion protein generated by a -1 ribosomal frameshift (8, 11). In our study, MrV40L (the 344 major dsRNA segment in MrV40) contained two overlapping ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2. We 345 identified a putative slippery site heptamer, 5′-GGGTTTT-3′, at the region from nt 1, 968 to 346 1,974 for the -1 ribosomal frameshift, which may be associated with production of the fusion 347 protein of 170 kDa in MrV40L. A previous study suggested that in the S. cerevisiae L-A virus, 348 the rate of ribosomal frameshifs was approximately 1.8%, giving 120 CP and 2 CP-RDRP 349 fusion protein molecules per virus particle (11). Considering the low efficiency of producing 350 the fusion proteins by ribosomal frameshifting, we expected to observe a significantly lower 351 translation rate of the fusion protein; indeed, the putative 170-kDa band was not detected by 352 SDS-PAGE. In addition to MrV40L, we determined the sequence of the satellite dsRNA 353 segment MrV40S and found that it consists of 1,355 nt containing a single ORF, ORF3, 354 producing a novel 15.6-kDa protein. As observed for other totiviruses, the possible toxin-like 355 activity of the protein was investigated in our study, but no growth inhibitory activity against 356 several bacteria and fungi was observed. 357 It has been estimated that 30-80% of fungal species in nature are infected with viruses, and a 358 fungal host normally shows no specific symptoms upon infection (14). However, several 359 genes were shown to be required for maintaining and propagating viruses in the host fungal 360 cells. In S. cerevisiae, numerous chromosomal genes are known to be involved in viral 361 propagation and expression of the viral killer toxin (35). Furthermore, several genes are 362 known to be responsible for maintaining the L-A virus and M dsRNA in S. cerevisiae. The 363 MAK genes are required for the propagation and maintenance of the L-A virus and M dsRNA : bioRxiv preprint 18 in S. cerevisiae (58). Among the MAK genes, MAK3, MAK10, and PET18 are required for the 365 maintenance of both L-A virus and M dsRNA, whereas all other MAK genes are responsible 366 only for M dsRNA (37-42). Particularly, MAK3 encodes an N-acetyltransferase and is 367 required for N-acetylation of the coat protein (37, 59). A previous study showed that the coat 368 proteins without acetylation failed to self-assemble, resulting in the loss of all dsRNA viruses 369 (38). MAK10 and PET18 (MAK30+MAK31) encode a non-catalytic subunit of N-terminal 370 acetyltransferase and a protein of unknown function, respectively. Mutant strains lacking 371 each gene contained unstable viral particles, indicating that the genes are involved in the 372 structural stability of LA-virus and M dsRNA (39). MAK1 (MAK17, TOP1) encodes DNA 373 topoisomerase I, and other MAK genes including MAK2, MAK5, MAK11, MAK16, MAK21, 374 MAK7 (RPL4A), MAK8 (TCM1), and MAK18 (RPL41B) are related to 60S ribosomal subunit 375 assembly (42, 60, 61). All mutant stains lacking the above genes showed decreased levels of 376 free 60S ribosomal subunits and the inability to maintain M dsRNA, suggesting that stable 377 propagation of the satellite dsRNA depends on 60S ribosome synthesis (41, 42). In addition 378 to the MAK genes, the SKI gene family has been shown to be involved in the maintenance 379 and propagation of virus in S. cerevisiae. SKI1 (XRN1) encoding a 5′-3′ exonuclease is 380 involved in the degradation of uncapped mRNA including viral mRNA, and SKI2, SKI3, 381 SKI6, SKI7, and SKI8 block the translation of viral mRNAs (62-64). In the current study, homologs of most MAK and SKI genes were identified in M. restricta. The results of the transcriptome analysis suggested that most MAK genes were downregulated, 384 which may in turn reduce ribosome synthesis in the M. restricta strain containing MrV40. In 385 contrast, no SKI homolog showed significantly altered transcript levels in the M. restricta 386 strain harboring MrV40. Moreover, we found increased expression of genes involved in : bioRxiv preprint 19 energy metabolism and programmed cell death in the M. restricta strain containing the virus. 388 Overall, our transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of only a few genes was 389 altered upon virus infection in M. restricta. Although the differential expression patterns 390 differed from that of M. restricta, S. cerevisiae also displayed relatively small changes in 391 fungal host gene expression upon virus infection, possibly because of co-adaptation of the 392 virus within the fungal host (65). Maintenance and propagation of virus within the fungal 393 host may be involved in the post-transcriptional mechanism and may contribute to the 394 minimal changes in host gene expression. Notably, the possibility that an RNA silencing 395 pathway in M. restricta cells influences virus maintenance was excluded because of the 396 absence of homologous genes required for the pathway in the genome of the fungus. 397 In addition to transcriptome analysis, we directly investigated whether the virus influences 398 the cellular morphology of M. restricta and the structures of its intracellular organelles by 399",A novel totivirus alters gene expression and vacuolar morphology in Malassezia cells and induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response Running Head: A novel totivirus in Malassezia
" The G-quadruplex structure forming motifs have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic drug target in various human pathogens. Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ -1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg 2+ and Fe 3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.",G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence
" Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (Electronic Supplement) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology, and important host-virus interactions.

" A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.",Profiling ACE2 expression in colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients by single-cell transcriptome analysis
" 1 transmission routes 2 Sk Shahid Nadim a , Indrajit Ghosh 1a , Joydev Chattopadhyay a 3 Abstract 5 In this paper, we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths: direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R 0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R 0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication. 7 12 directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly through a vector. Understanding the transmission 13 dynamics of such diseases is of utmost interest. Mathematical models of epidemic diseases have been 14 very insightful in uncovering epidemiology and transmission patterns of the diseases. It is very important 15 to understand such epidemic patterns for better public health interventions and control of outbreaks. 16 Another important objective of these models is to inform public health organizations about the effect of 17 control policies on a certain population. However, hosts behaviour and psychological factors are some-18 times the main drivers of further transmission of the disease. For example, the epidemic outbreak of 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3; 4) had such psychological effects and individual protection 20 1 doi: bioRxiv preprint 32 However, the dynamics of an epidemic model with two transmission routes where the direct trans-33 mission incorporates psychological effect has not been studied so far. The ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic 34 and zika virus epidemic are examples of diseases with two routes of transmission having psychological 35 effects. The psychosocial implication on the disease outbreak is more dangerous than any other phys-36 ical effect. West Nile Virus outbreak in the US is a good example for the onset of psychogenic illness 37 (10) and may generate mistrust towards national or health authorities. For example, the mild effects 38 of Zika virus, there is a correlation between psychosis with fetus microcephaly where pregnant women 39 and their relatives are highly sensitive group. Therefore, there is a negative correlation between the 40 psychological effect and disease prevalence and hence we consider non-monotone incidence function i.e 41 p < q to describe the direct transmission between hosts in our study. This type of function can be used 42 to interpret the ""psychological effects"" (11). We use the incidence rate g(I)S = βIS 1+αI 2 where βI repre-43 sent the force of infection of the diseases, 1 1+αI 2 represent the psychological effect from the behavioral 44 changes of susceptible population when the number of infected populations increases. Our goal is to 45 develop a simple mathematical model that capture a range of disease dynamics with multiple mode of 46 transmissions. Moreover, we would like to perform a detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of the 47 proposed model. By using analytical methods we intend to uncover the dynamical properties of the 48 diseases with two routes of transmission. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 consist of the model formulation and the 50 basic assumptions. In Section 3, preliminary mathematical analysis of the proposed model is carried out. Section 4 is devoted to the global stability of the endemic equilibrium using geometric approach while 52 in Section 5 backward bifurcation and forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect is presented. In Section 53 6 we investigate some numerical scenarios such as effect of temporary control on bistable dynamics, 54 effect of the strength of psychological fear and impact of heterogeneity in indirect transmission. Finally, 55 discussion and conclusion is presented in Section 7. 56 2. Model formulation 57 We consider two population groups as host and vector population. Time-dependent state variables 58 are taken to describe the compartments of the two populations. Let at time t, N h (t) represents total 59 host population and N v (t) represents total vector population. We consider a 'SIR' type model for the 60 host population and a 'SI' type model for the vectors. The host population is subdivided into three 61 mutually disjoint classes: susceptible, S h ; infected, I h ; recovered, R h . Thus, at any time t, the size of 62 the host population is given by N h = S h + I h + R h . The vector population consist of two classes namely, 63 susceptible vectors, S v ; and infected vectors, I v . With this division, the size of the vector population 64 2 . CC-BY 4.0 The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the number of secondary infections which one infected indi-102 vidual would produce in a entirely susceptible population. The disease free equilibrium (DFE) of the 103 system is given by Y 0 = ( Π h µ h , 0, 0, Πv µv , 0). There are two infected compartments in the model (2.1), I h 104 and I v . R 0 can be derived from the jacobian matrix of the system (2.1) calculated at Y 0 together with 105 the assumption of local asymptotic stability of Y 0 and is given by",Global dynamics of a general vector-borne disease model with two
" Understanding and quantifying the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is essential for 24 directing public health responses, especially for pathogens capable of transmission between 25 humans. However, determining a pathogen's transmission dynamics is complicated by 26 challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of 27 transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of 28 surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these 29 challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. 30 After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new 31 method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program 32 from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates 33 of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and 34 suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. 35 Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that 36 around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred 37 using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate 38 spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be 39 incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns. 40 Author Summary Surveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and 42 epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as 43 possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding 44 .

We first used simulated datasets to 47 explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could 48 be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial 49 information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of 50 human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic 51 Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, 52 spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans. 53 [1][2] [3] [4] [5][6][7][8]. By definition, zoonotic pathogens can transmit from animals to humans; those also 58 capable of human-to-human transmission are of particular public health concern [5, 9] . Infectious 59 disease surveillance serves a crucial role for detecting and gathering information on zoonotic 60 pathogens: data obtained through surveillance are often the primary resource available for 61 informing public health management decisions [10]. Developing methods that improve our 62 ability to infer information about a pathogen's transmission dynamics from available 63 surveillance data is therefore an essential frontier for understanding and ultimately combating 64 these pathogens [11, 12]. 65 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 For zoonoses, three epidemiological measures are crucial for summarizing transmission 66 dynamics and informing risk assessments. The first of these is the spillover rate, which indicates 67 how frequently the pathogen is transmitted from the animal reservoir into humans and helps 68 inform the total expected disease incidence [13]. The second measure describes the pathogen's 69 potential for further spread once in the human population and is commonly assessed using the 70 reproductive number (R), which gives the average number of secondary human cases caused by 71 an infectious individual [14, 15]. Values of R greater than one indicate that the pathogen is 72 capable of sustained (i.e. 'supercritical') transmission in humans. Pathogens with subcritical 73 transmission (R less than one but greater than zero) can cause limited chains of transmission in 74 humans after a zoonotic introduction, and they pose a risk of acquiring ability for supercritical 75 transmission via evolutionary or environmental change [2,5,16]. The third epidemiological 76 measure is the distance over which human-to-human transmission occurs, which informs how 77 the disease will spread spatially and the risk of it being introduced into new populations. 78 Combined, these three measures can help evaluate the current public health threat posed by the 79 pathogen, the risk of future emergence, and the most effective approaches for disease 80 management. 81 Estimating epidemiological measures is a challenging task in any pathogen system, and 82 the unique properties of zoonotic diseases can exacerbate these difficulties. Infectious disease 83 surveillance often records temporal information and certain aspects of spatial information about 84 human cases, but the underlying transmission events are seldom observed. In a zoonotic system, 85 this means that an observed human infection could have been caused by a previous human case 86 or by zoonotic spillover. Without intensive contact tracing, or sequence data in the case of fast-87 evolving pathogens, quantifying the relative contribution of zoonotic versus human-to-human 88 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 transmission is a major challenge; identifying the source of infection for specific individuals is 89 an even bigger one. 90 Epidemiological analyses are often hindered by data truncation and unknown 91 denominators [17,18]. In many disease surveillance systems, the total set of localities under 92 surveillance (i.e. those that would appear in the dataset if a case occurred there) can be separated 93 into 'observed localities,' which appear in the dataset because they reported one or more cases, 94 and 'silent localities,' which have no cases during the surveillance period and therefore do not 95 appear in the dataset. This form of truncation, where localities with zero cases are absent from 96 the dataset, obscures the true scope of the surveillance effort. Without knowledge of the total 97 number of localities under observation (the 'unknown denominator'), accurately estimating the 98 spillover rate and probability of human-to-human transmission between localities is not 99 straightforward. Simply disregarding these silent localities in the analysis is the functional 100 equivalent of selectively removing zeros from the dataset and can lead to problematic inference 101 biases. 102 Complicating inference efforts further is the fact that surveillance datasets often report 103 the geographic location of cases only at a coarse resolution, obscuring information about a 104 transmission process that occurs on a much finer scale [19] [20][21]. Precise spatial information is 105 often absent from historic datasets and data collected in remote or low-resource areas, replaced 106 by the names of the locality and broader administrative units where the case occurred. For 107 example, only the village name and the region and country to which the village belongs may be 108 recorded in a dataset. Furthermore, linking a village name to spatial coordinates is often 109 impossible when maps of the region do not exist or only unofficial local names are used. 110 Although collecting exact spatial coordinates has become more practical in contemporary disease 111 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 surveillance, privacy and confidentiality concerns can arise in both human and agricultural 112 contexts when data contains high-resolution spatial information [19, 20,[22][23][24][25], leading to data 113 being reported in a non-localized manner. Methods that can use this inexact spatial information 114 are especially needed for zoonotic diseases, where any additional information about the 115 proximity of human cases to one another can improve the power to distinguish between human-116 to-human transmission and zoonotic spillover. 117 Despite these challenges, a series of research efforts have expanded our ability to 118 estimate the transmission properties of zoonotic pathogens from case onset data. A key set of 119 methods revolve around inferring R from the sizes of case clusters (a cluster is defined as a group 120 of cases that occur in close spatiotemporal proximity to one another) or from the proportion of 121 observed cases that were infected by zoonotic spillover [16,[26][27][28][29][30]. However, these approaches 122 either require detailed case investigations to determine whether a case was infected by a zoonotic 123 or human source or assume that each cluster is caused by one single spillover event followed by 124 human-to-human transmission. A likelihood-based approach for estimating R for human-to-125 human transmission using only symptom onset dates of cases was introduced by Wallinga and 126 Teunis [31]. This method was extended to apply to zoonotic systems by Lo Iacono et al. [32], but 127 the extension requires that chains of exclusively human-to-human transmission can be identified, 128 and is thus not applicable to many zoonotic surveillance systems where human and zoonotic 129 transmissions are intermixed. A different approach was taken by White and Pagano [33], who 130 introduced a different likelihood-based method that compares the observed number of cases on 131 each day with the expected number, as calculated using the number and timing of previous cases. 132 Though the White and Pagano approach was only applicable to human-to-human transmission, it 133 was expanded by Kucharski et al. [34] to work in zoonotic spillover systems in scenarios where a 134 .

To make use of this form of non-localized spatial data, our 152 model considers two scales of spatial mixing and transmission (Fig 1A) , reminiscent of the 153 'epidemics with two levels of mixing' structure utilized in Ball et al. [41] and Demiris and 154 O'Neill [42]. The first mixing level is the locality in which the case occurred, such as a village, 155 conceptualized as a group of individuals geographically separated from other localities. We 156 assume that individuals within the same locality have more frequent contact with one another 157 .

" Inspired by bioactive biaryl-containing natural products found in plants and the marine 19 environment, a series of synthetic compounds belonging to the azaBINOL chiral ligand family 20 was evaluated for antiviral activity against HIV-1. Testing of 39 unique azaBINOLs in a single-21 round infectivity assay resulted in the identification of three promising antiviral compounds, 22 including 7-isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline (azaBINOL B#24), which exhibited low-23 micromolar activity. The active compounds and several close structural analogues were further 24 tested against three different HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well as in a full-virus 25 replication system (EASY-HIT).

" The ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged public health surveillance, response, and control systems. Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.",International travelers and genomics uncover a 'hidden' Zika outbreak
" With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. : Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.",Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens
" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS-and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 -a virus causing current world-wide epidemics.

" 22 Secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection is a significant cause of mortality 23 worldwide. Upper respiratory tract pneumococcal carriage is important as both determinants of 24 disease and population transmission. The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcal 25 carriage are well-studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of carriage 26 following influenza infection is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia during seasonal and 27 pandemic outbreaks. We used a human type 6B pneumococcal challenge model to show that 28 carriage acquisition induces early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of 29 monocytes to the nose.

" Pleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1 . Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1 , which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes. : bioRxiv preprint / Here, we use linkage mapping to identify a single overlapping QTL on chromosome V that influences the responses to eight chemotherapeutic compounds. We show that these drug-response QTL also overlap with an expression QTL hotspot that contains the gene scb-1 , previously implicated in bleomycin response (Brady et al. 2019) . Although the exact mechanism of scb-1 is yet unknown, it is hypothesized to act in response to stress (Riedel et al. 2013 ) and has weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Zhang et al. 2018; Kelley et al. 2015) . Together, these data suggest that the importance of scb-1 expression might extend beyond bleomycin response. We validated the QTL using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and performed mediation analysis to predict that scb-1 expression explains the observed QTL for five of the eight drugs. Finally, we directly tested the effect of scb-1 loss of function on chemotherapeutic responses. We discovered that expression of scb-1 underlies differential responses to several chemotherapeutics that cause double-strand DNA breaks, not just bleomycin. This discovery of pleiotropy helps to further define the role of scb-1 by expanding its known functions and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the nematode drug response. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals were grown at 20°C on modified nematode growth media (NGMA) containing 1% agar and 0.7% agarose to prevent burrowing and fed OP50 ( Ghosh et al. 2012) . The two parental strains, the canonical laboratory strain, N2, and the wild isolate from Hawaii, CB4856, were used to generate all recombinant lines. 208 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) generated previously by Rockman et al. (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) (set 1 RIAILs) were phenotyped for expression QTL mapping (detailed below). A second set of 296 RIAILs generated previously by Andersen et al. (Andersen et al. 2015) (set 2 RIAILs) was used more extensively for drug phenotyping and linkage mapping. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were generated by backcrossing a selected RIAIL for several generations (Brady et al. 2019) , using PCR amplicons for insertion-deletion (indels) variants to track the introgressed region. NILs were whole-genome sequenced to verify clean introgressions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletions of scb-1 were described in Brady et al. (Brady et al. 2019) . All strains are available upon request or from the C. elegans Natural Diversity Resource (Cook et al. 2016) . For dose responses and RIAIL phenotyping, we used a high-throughput fitness assay (HTA) described previously . In summary, populations of each strain were passaged and amplified on NGMA plates for four generations. In the fifth generation, gravid adults were bleach-synchronized and 25-50 embryos from each strain were aliquoted into 96-well microtiter plates at a final volume of 50 µL K medium (Boyd, Smith, and Freedman 2012) . The following day, arrested L1s were fed HB101 bacterial lysate (Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; (García-González et al. 2017) ) at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL in K medium and were grown to the L4 larval stage for 48 hours at 20°C with constant shaking. Three L4 larvae were sorted into new 96-well microtiter plates containing 10 mg/mL HB101 bacterial lysate, 50 µM kanamycin, and either diluent (1% water or 4 .

" We live in a world of emerging new diseases and old diseases resurging in more aggressive forms. Drug development by pharmaceutical companies is a market-driven and costly endeavor, and thus it is often a challenge when drugs are needed for diseases endemic only to certain regions or which affect only a few patients. However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery. In this study, we leverage biomedical data and tools to analyze available data on Nipah Virus (NiV) infection. NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.

" After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 . The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.",Clinical Characteristics of Two Human to Human Transmitted Coronaviruses: Corona Virus Disease 2019 versus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
" 1 Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of 3 the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global 4 community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted 5 diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and 6 support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. 7 We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 8 2019-nCoV outbreak. 9 Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on 10 January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or 11 working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in 12 information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and 13 treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. 14 Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the 15 information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the 16 local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, 17 particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under 18 quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) 19 and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both 20 strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores.

The ELPA flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS. 27 The morphological analyses used light and fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle and DNA 28 fragmentation analyses used flow cytometry to determine the mechanism of cell death induced 29 by ELPA in HL-60. Among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated; ELPA stood out with high 30 cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis and P. quadrangulares with varying high and low 31 cytotoxic activity. ELPA presented high cytotoxic potency in HL-60 (IC 50 19.37 μg/mL), yet 32 without cytotoxic activity against PBMC, suggesting selectivity for tumor cells. The cytotoxic 33 activity of ELPA may well be linked to the presence of ten identified flavonoids. Cells treated 34 with ELPA presented the hallmarks typical of apoptosis and necrosis, with cell cycle arrest in 35 the G2/M phase. Conclusion: From among the studied species, ELPA presented greater 36 cytotoxic activity, possibly a consequence of synergistic flavonoid action which induces cell 37 death by apoptosis and necrosis.",Evaluation of the cytotoxic potential of extracts from the genus Passiflora 2 cultived in Brazil against cancer cells
" The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is causing widespread infections and significant mortality. Previous studies describing clinical characteristics of the disease contained small cohorts from individual centers or larger series consisting of mixed cases from different hospitals. We report analyses of mortality and disease severity among 402 patients from a single hospital. The cohort included 297 patients with confirmed and 105 with suspected diagnosis. The latter group met the criteria for clinical diagnosis but nucleic acid tests results were initially interpreted as suspicious. Data were compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, patients 70 years of age or older suffered a significantly higher mortality (17.8%), associated with more patients having severe or critical illness (57.5%). Patients 50 years of age or older had a mortality of 8.0%, and those younger than 50 years, 1.2%. Male patients had a mortality of 7.6% versus 2.9% in females.","Clinical outcomes of 402 patients with COVID-2019 from a single center in Wuhan, China"
" 24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69 which is composed of seventeen proteins [1, 13]. These enzymes use NAD + as co-factor to 70 transfer ADP-ribose onto a substrate protein with release of nicotinamide. Based on their 71 . : bioRxiv preprint 4 catalytic features the ARTDs are subdivided into three classes. The first class contains ARTD1, 72 2, 5, and 6, which are capable of transferring multiple ADP-ribose moieties in an iterative 73 process and thereby forming long polymers. This results in poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) 74 of substrate proteins. The second and largest class is defined by members that are restricted 75 to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (ARTD3, 4,(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(14)(15)(16)(17), whereas the third 76 group is defined by ARTD13, which lacks the ability to bind NAD + and thus is catalytically 77 inactive [18]. 78 79 PARylation, arguably best known for its function in DNA damage response, has also been 80 linked to chromatin organization, ribosome biogenesis, telomere maintenance, signaling 81 processes and cell death [1, 19, 20]. In contrast functions of MARylation are less well 82 understood but expanding with links to DNA damage repair, gene expression, signaling, stress 83 response and cell death [1, 21]. Recent findings indicate a role for MARylation in host-84 pathogen conflicts [1, 21, 22]. The expression of several mono-ARTDs is triggered by type I 85 interferons (IFNs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS, as part of an 86 innate immune response to pathogens [6, 8, 11,[23][24][25]. Among these mono-ARTDs are ARTD7, 87 ARTD10 and ARTD12, which have been identified to mediate clearance of Venezuelan Equine 88 Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) by interfering with viral replication [7, 8]. In line with this, Zika virus 89 replication is restricted by ARTD12 [26] . In addition to these molecular and cell-based studies, 90 evolutionary analysis suggests a role for several ARTD family members at the host-pathogen 91 interface, among them the macrodomain containing ARTDs (ARTD7-9) and ARTD13 [27]. 92 Although catalytically inactive, the latter is best studied for being restrictive for viral 93 replication by recognizing foreign CG-rich RNA through its Zinc finger domains [28, 29]. 94 95 .

" In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest 10 refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new 11 refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many 12 population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among 13 the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological 14 parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness 15 of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent 16 outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of 17 the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance 18 of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low 19 vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks. 20",Quantifying the success of measles vaccination campaigns in the Rohingya refugee camps
" The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.",Characterizing the transmission and identifying the control strategy for COVID-19 through epidemiological modeling

" Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. Because ZIKV uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack 36 of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains 37 derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that 40 ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-41 SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV. Our findings represent the first detailed mapping 42 of N-glycans on ZIKV E of various strains and their functional significance. 43 44 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Recently, 47 the considerable increase in ZIKV infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, 48 especially after the outbreaks in Yap Islands (2007) 3,4 , French Polynesia (2013) 5,6 , Easter Island 49 (2014) 7 , and Brazil (2015) 8,9 . These ZIKV outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in 50 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and 51 paralysis of the limbs and face. In 2015, Zika spread to South and Central America, infecting 52 thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it was associated with an increase in GBS 53 rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities including spontaneous 54 abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental 55 insufficiency 10-14 . ZIKV is a small, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus 15 . The genomic RNA 56 of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 57 polyprotein 16,17 . This polyprotein undergoes co-and post-translational processing to produce 58 three structural proteins, which are capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), in 59 addition to seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 17,18 . 60 Of the three structural proteins, E is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (I, 61 II, III) and two transmembrane helices 17-19 . The majority of flaviviruses E proteins are post-62 translationally modified by N-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved 63 glycosylation motif of N-X-T/S at positions 154-156 (where X is any amino acid except proline) 64 16 . This is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry 20 . 65 Previously, it was demonstrated that the N-glycosylation sites on the E protein of flaviviruses are 66 highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 1) , playing a vital role in both infectivity and assembly 67 All rights reserved.

When produced in 103 C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells, these N-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by 104 sialylated glycans. For these four cell lines, bi-and tri-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3241.8 105 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on ZIKV E, followed by bi-sialylated bi-106 antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-glycans 107 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) . ZIKV E produced in SNB19 cells was also found to be decorated 108 with Man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated 109 bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-110 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). When expressed in the LLC-MK2 and JEG-9 cell lines, the 111 N-glycan profiles of MR766 and IbH strains of E were markedly different. When produced in 112 LLC-MK2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated 113 (1836.0 m/z) N-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (Supplementary Fig. 114 4a, b). More complex N-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine 115 repeats, were not identified in ZIKV E expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, the ZIKV E 116 produced in JEG-3 cells revealed a different N-glycosylation pattern between MR766 and IbH 117 strains. While the di-and tri-sialylated N-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the 118 most abundant for the MR766 ZIKV-E produced in JEG-3, the variety of N-glycans identified in 119 JEG-3 cells was greater, notably including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), Man 6 GlcNAc 2 (1784.0 120 m/z), Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (1988.1 m/z), Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 121 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycans (Supplementary Fig.   122 4a). In contrast, the IbH strain produced in the JEG-3 cells displayed a more restricted N-glycan 123 profile, with the notable absence of sialylated N-glycans and with the core fucosylated asialo-bi-124 All rights reserved.

" The genus Torovirus (subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) 12 encompasses a range of species that infect domestic ungulates including cattle, 13 sheep, goats, pigs and horses, causing an acute self-limiting gastroenteritis. Using the 14 prototype species equine torovirus (EToV) we performed parallel RNA sequencing 15 (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyse the relative expression levels 16 of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimaeric sequences produced via 17 discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle) and 18 changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA 19 sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and 20 non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we 21 identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs 22 encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes 23 efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5' 24 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic 25 analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus 26 .

" Viruses are known to have some of the highest and most diverse mutation rates found 12 in any biological replicator, with single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses evolving the fastest, 13 and double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses having rates approaching those of bacteria. As 14 mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear 15 driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of 16 viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-17 term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, 18 dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence 19 for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly 20 affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, 21 and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, 22 the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life 23 cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary 24 processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the 25 joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the 26 evolutionary trajectories of viruses -and possibly of their epidemiological potential. 27",Viral long-term evolutionary strategies favor stability 1 over proliferation
" Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with complex etiologies and genetic architecture. Animal models have a critical role in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Here we studied epilepsy utilizing a genetic reference population of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice with publicly available whole genome sequences. We measured multiple epilepsy traits in 35 CC strains, and we identified novel animal models that exhibit extreme outcomes in seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We performed QTL mapping in an F2 population and identified seven novel and one previously identified loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequence and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes and candidate variants associated with seizure sensitivity. These resources provide a powerful toolbox for studying complex features of seizures and for identifying genes associated with particular seizure outcomes, and hence will facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

" Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, therapeutically intractable liver cancer that disproportionately affects youth. Although FLC tumors exhibit a distinct gene expression profile, the causative transcriptional mechanisms remain unclear. Here we used chromatin run-on sequencing to discover approximately 7,000 enhancers and 141 enhancer hotspots activated in FLC relative to non-malignant liver. Detailed bioinformatic analyses revealed aberrant ERK/MEK signaling and candidate master transcriptional regulators. We also defined the genes most strongly associated with aberrant FLC enhancer activity, including CA12 and SLC16A14. Treatment of FLC cell models with inhibitors of CA12 or SLC16A14 independently reduced cell viability and/or significantly enhanced the effect of MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. These findings highlight new molecular targets for drug development as well as novel drug combination approaches.",Hotspots of aberrant enhancer activity in fibrolamellar carcinoma reveal molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and intrinsic drug resistance

Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.","Title: The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections among travellers from Wuhan, China"
" As the predominant etiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is 19 the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types. 30 31 38",50-valent inactivated rhinovirus vaccine is broadly immunogenic in rhesus macaques
" We have developed a generalizable 'smart molecular diagnostic' capable of accurate point-ofcare (POC) detection of variable nucleic acid targets. Our one-pot isothermal assay relies on multiplex execution of four loop-mediated isothermal amplification reactions, with primers that are degenerate and redundant, thereby increasing the breadth of targets while reducing the probability of amplification failure. An easy-to-read visual answer is computed directly by a multi-input Boolean OR gate signal transducer that uses degenerate strand exchange probes to assess any combination of amplicons. We demonstrate our platform by using the same assay to detect divergent Asian and African lineages of the evolving Zika virus (ZIKV), while maintaining selectivity against non-target viruses. Direct analysis of biological specimens proved possible, with 20 virions / µl being directly detected in human saliva within 90 minutes, and crudely macerated ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes being identified with 100% specificity and sensitivity. The ease-of-use with minimal instrumentation, broad programmability, and built-in fail-safe reliability make our smart molecular diagnostic attractive for POC use. While point-of-care (POC) diagnostic assays can be performed at or near the site of sample acquisition, they have for the most part been considered to be relatively simplistic tests that provide relatively little information to a clinician or public health worker. Familiar examples include electrochemical sensors for glucose, 1 or rapid immunoassays for metabolites such as human chorionic gonadotropin (the canonical pregnancy test), 2 and pathogens, either directly (influenza viruses) or via immune responses (antibodies against HIV-1/2). 3 The range of conditions and pathogens that could be tested for could likely be greatly expanded by developing POC diagnostics for nucleic acids 3 that would have greater sensitivity and accuracy. However, the current gold standard for molecular diagnostics, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), requires significant technical expertise and expensive and cumbersome equipment. Even portable instruments, such the Cepheid GeneXpert Omni, cost several thousand dollars and rely on expensive qPCR cartridge consumables for individual tests.",Multiplex logic processing isothermal diagnostic assays for an evolving virus

The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K + loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. 1 severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay.

" Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV. author/funder.

" first two authors contribute equally. Zika virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika, but unfortunately no vaccine or medicine is available so far. Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for its replication and thus represents an attractive target for drug discovery/design. Here we characterized conformation, Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes by both experiments and MD simulations. The results unveil the unique properties of Zika NS2B-NS3pro which are very different from Dengue one. Particularly, CD and NMR studies indicate that unlike Dengue, the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B with a significant sequence variation is highly disordered in the open conformation. Indeed, MD simulations reveal that up to 100 ns, the Dengue NS2B C-terminus constantly has close contacts with its NS3pro domain. By a sharp contrast, the Zika NS2B C-terminus loses the contacts with its NS3pro domain after 10 ns, further forming a short β-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation at 30 ns. Furthermore, we found that a small molecule, previously identified as an active site inhibitor for other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro, inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro potently in an allosteric manner. Our study provides the first insight into the dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers that it is susceptible to allosteric inhibition, which thus bears critical implications for the future development of therapeutic allosteric inhibitors. author/funder.

" Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, 49 characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and 50 appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1β, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1β and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of 65 mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit 66 increment in IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 67 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year had significantly 68 decreased by an average of 18.45 compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's 69 duration of ≥ 5years (reference group).

In conclusion, this study indicates that 75 both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 in 76 eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative 77 impact on disease progression. 78 79 Authors Summary 80 Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may 81 result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is 82 a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas.

" Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive 16 measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead 17 to large transmission clusters. Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying 18 which individuals and regions might be most at risk. 19 As data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined 20 age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation 21 status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. 22 We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through 23 detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the 24 importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. 25 The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation 26 status before running the model. 27",Title: Probabilistic reconstruction of measles transmission Authors
" Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to transform microbial detection and characterization, but new tools are needed to improve its sensitivity. We developed CATCH (Compact Aggregation of Targets for Comprehensive Hybridization), a computational method to enhance nucleic acid capture for enrichment of diverse microbial taxa. CATCH designs compact probe sets that achieve full coverage of known sequence diversity and that scale well with this diversity. To illustrate applications of CATCH, we focused on capturing viral genomes. We designed, synthesized, and validated multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriched unique viral content on average 18× and allowed us to assemble genomes that we could not otherwise recover, while accurately preserving within-sample diversity. We used this approach to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of viral infections in samples with unknown content. Together, this work demonstrates a path toward more sensitive, cost-effective metagenomic sequencing.",Capturing diverse microbial sequence with comprehensive and scalable probe design

" Objective: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medical advice seeking of Chinese children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). : An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. The study can well explore the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the medical treatment of CKD children in China and the needs of current patients. The study explored ways to meet the medical needs of CKD children in the context of a public health emergency of international concern, which provides a method support for all countries in the world experiencing COVID-19 outbreak. The study is an exploration of the coping strategies for CKD management in China. The limitations of this study is that it is quite simple and descriptive, and many studies need to be further carried out.",The Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Medical Treatment of Chinese Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)：A Multicenter Cross-section Study in the Context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
" Background 33 An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to 35 other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by 36 SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. 37 We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, 39 dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. 40 A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic 41 epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules 42 of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 43 Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. 44 The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well 46 captured (R 2 >0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among 47 (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .","Title: Intrinsic growth rules of patients infected, dead and cured with 2019 novel 1 coronavirus in mainland China 2"
" Background: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak with case-count time series from prior outbreaks to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. Methods: For short-and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short-and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott's rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. Results: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872-1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874-1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876-933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877-983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013-2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. Conclusions: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.

Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has been reported, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used an ensemble of models to estimate EVD transmission rates and to forecast the short-and long-term course of the outbreak. Our models project that a final size of roughly up to 300 additional cases is most likely, and estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under optimal levels of contact tracing and vaccination.

" We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low. .

" COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22 nd to February 9 th , 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.","Title: Optimizing diagnostic strategy for novel coronavirus pneumonia, a multi-center study in Eastern China Authors (email addresses): Affiliations: Correspondence to"
" 15 Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include 16 vaccines and antivirals. Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, 17 alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the 18 use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar 19 epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours 20 post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly up-regulated, including the cell adhesion 21 molecule CEACAM1. The up-regulation of CEACAM1 was blocked in the presence of the 22 reactive oxygen species inhibitor, apocynin. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher 23 CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus, suggesting a 24 key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous 25 CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as 26 well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides 27 evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and 28 may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies. 29 30 IMPORTANCE 31 Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus continues to pose a potential pandemic 32 threat. Therapeutic strategies that enhance host immune responses to promote clearance of 33 influenza virus infection are urgently needed.

" Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5 o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5 o C, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease. Patients. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and management data from the medical records of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. On Jan 20, 2020, the first human case of in Shanghai was confirmed. Since then all hospitals in Shanghai have opened special fever clinics to screen suspected patients, and laboratory confirmed patients were then admitted to a single designated hospital in Shanghai (Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were obtained from all patients at admission and maintained in viral transport medium. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol as described previously 3 . Confirmed patients were hospitalized into negative pressure wards for further medical observation and treatment. We collected data from patients who were admitted from Jan. 20 up to Feb. 15. All the data collected from the included cases have been shared with the WHO. Data Collection. Epidemiological exposure data, patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings and medical history were extracted from electronic medical records and analysed by licensed physicians.

" The large magnitude of protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs within the human interactome necessitates the development of predictive models and screening tools to better understand this fundamental molecular communication. However, despite enormous efforts from various groups to develop predictive techniques in the last decade, PPI complex structures are in general still very challenging to predict due to the large number of degrees of freedom. In this study, we use the binding complex of human profilin (PFN1) and polyproline-10 (P10) as a model system to examine various approaches, with the aim of going beyond normal protein docking for PPI prediction and evaluation. The potential of mean force (PMF) was first obtained from the timeconsuming umbrella sampling, which confirmed that the most stable binding structure identified by the maximal PMF difference is indeed the crystallographic binding structure. Moreover, crucial residues previously identified in experimental studies, W3, H133 and S137 of PFN1, were found to form favorable hydrogen bonds with P10, suggesting a zipping process during the binding between PFN1 and P10. We then explored both regular molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, seeking for better criteria of ranking the PPI prediction. Despite valuable information obtained from conventional MD simulations, neither the commonly used interaction energy between the two binding parties nor the long-term root mean square displacement (RMSD) correlates well with the PMF results. On the other hand, with a sizable collection of trajectories, we demonstrated that the average rupture work calculated from SMD simulations correlates fairly well with the PMFs (R 2 = 0.67), making it a promising PPI screening method.

" This study tests the hypothesis that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by physiologically-relevant concentrations of interleukin-33 (IL-33) contributes to enhanced cytokine expression by IL-12 stimulated human natural killer (NK) cells. While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN- by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN- and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

" The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA 23 viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3¢à5¢exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 24 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN 25 catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN 26 activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased 27 fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) 28 genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in 29 parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated 30 enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive 31 fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-32 inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA 33 polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the 34 observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness 35 observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can 36 compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors 37 restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) 38 reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV 39 fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity. 40 41 42 All rights reserved.

" medRxiv preprint Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province.

" The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP 60 are needed to validate these therapeutic effects. 61 62",Therapeutic effects of dipyridamole on COVID-19 patients with 1 coagulation dysfunction

Despite intense research 26 effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable 27 uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, 28 Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been 29 reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12 nd 2019. Epidemiological 30 investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested 31 that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven 32 patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 33 (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, 34 dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 35 26 th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing 4 identified a novel RNA virus 36 from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). 37 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that 38 WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of 39 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, 40 subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history 41 of genomic recombination.

Patients 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 had 49 cough, while patients 1, 2 and 7 presented with severe cough with phlegm at onset of illness. 50 Patients 4 and 5 also complained of chest tightness and dyspnea. Patients 1, 3, 4 and 6 51 experienced dizziness and patient 3 felt weakness. No neurological symptoms were observed 52 in any of the patients. Bacterial culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus bacteria in 53 throat swabs from patients 3, 4 and 7. Combination antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid 54 therapy were administered. Unfortunately, patient 1 and 4 showed respiratory failure: patient 55 1 was given high flow noninvasive ventilation, while patient 4 was provided with nasal/face 56 mask ventilation (Table 1) . Epidemiological investigation by the Wuhan CDC revealed that all the suspected cases 58 were linked to individuals working in a local indoor seafood market. Notably, in addition to 59 fish and shell fish, a variety of live wild animals including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and 60 birds (turtledoves) were available for sale in the market before the outbreak began, as well as 61 animal carcasses and animal meat. No bats were available for sale. While the patients might 62 have had contact with wild animals in the market, none recalled exposure to live poultry. Patient 1 was a 41-year-old man with no history of hepatitis, tuberculosis or diabetes. He was admitted and hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital 6 days after the onset of illness.

The median incubation period of 2019-nCoV ARD was 3.0 days and it had a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Disease severity independently predicted the composite endpoint. Our study provided further evidence of human-to-human transmission. Around only 1% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, while more than three quarters were local residents of Wuhan, or had contacted with people from Wuhan.

" Non-viral gene delivery is constrained by the dwell time that most synthetic nucleic acid nanocarriers spend inside endosomal compartments. In order to overcome this endosomalrelease bottleneck, methods are required that measure nanocarrier uptake kinetics and transfection efficiency simultaneously. Here, we employ live-cell imaging on single-cell arrays (LISCA) to study the delivery-time distribution of lipid-based mRNA complexes under varied serum conditions. By fitting a translation-maturation model to hundreds of individual eGFP reporter fluorescence time courses, the protein expression onset times and the expression rates after transfection are determined. Using this approach, we find that delivery timing and protein expression rates are not intrinsically correlated at the single-cell level, even though population-averaged values of both parameters conjointly change as a function of increasing external serum protein fraction. Lipofectamine mediated delivery showed decreased transfection efficiency and longer delivery times with increasing serum protein concentration. This is in contrast to ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) mediated transfer, which showed increased efficiency and faster uptake in the presence of serum. In conclusion, the interdependences of single-cell expression rates and onset timing provide additional clues on uptake and release mechanisms, which are useful for improving nucleic acid delivery. author/funder.

" Abstract ) is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. During the formation of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC), essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease M pro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp's. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2:2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.",Processing of the SARS-CoV pp1a/ab nsp7-10 region
" SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants. Various estimates and analyses suggest SARS-CoV-2 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may have similar transmissibility with an estimated reproductive number (R 0 ) of 3.77 (2.23-4.82) for SARS-CoV-2 and between 2.9-3.3 for SARS-CoV 8 . SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common host-cell receptor protein, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on epithelial cells in the respiratory track system and various human organs, such as the lung 9,10 . Receptor recognition by coronaviruses is the first and essential step for infecting host cells 11,12 . An envelope-anchored trimeric spike (S) protein mediates the binding of the two coronaviruses to human ACE2 13,14 , and is cleaved by the host protease into two separate polypeptides as S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which is responsible for the homotrimer formation and mediates fusion of the virion with cellular membranes 15 . The receptor binding motif (RBM) in RBD is responsible for direct binding to ACE2 and its binding affinity may directly affects the virus infectivity and transmissibility 16, 17 .

" Declaring the end of an outbreak is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulationbased model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-ofoutbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","A quantitative framework to define the end of an outbreak: application to Ebola Virus Disease ""A quantitative framework to define the end of an outbreak: application to Ebola Virus Disease"""
" The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Proteinprotein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein : bioRxiv preprint 2 docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2. key words: COVID-19, ACE2, viral spike Receptor Binding Domain, 1 homology-based protein-protein docking, variants.","In silico study of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2: similarity with SARS-CoV, hot-spot analysis and effect of the receptor polymorphism"
" Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming widely adopted as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozen-hydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.",Vitrification after multiple rounds of sample application and blotting improves particle density on cryo-electron microscopy grids
" Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.","Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China"
" High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are nanoparticles with >80 associated proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. A comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local, cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Variations in apolipoprotein A-II and apolipoprotein C-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of co-varying proteins and define a protein-protein interaction network describing the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1 specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size suggesting a multi genetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, supporting the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL's properties such as protection against CAD.",Genetic control of the HDL proteome

" The ability to rapidly assemble and prototype cellular circuits is vital for biological research and its applications in biotechnology and medicine. Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health. and Extensible Mammalian Modular Assembly kit (EMMA) 3 based on Golden Gate assembly reactions were proposed. Both methods use sets of modular parts with given functionality, which can be assembled directionally into transcription units (TUs) by type-IIS restriction enzymes. While useful, all three methods have important shortcomings. GMAP requires sequencing in between all cloning steps, which makes the method slow and expensive. EMMA and mMoClo provide a method to hierarchically assemble DNA vectors that encode large circuits, but fall short on shareability, integration of Cas9 sgRNA cloning, a library of tested parts, and ease of use. While in yeast and plant systems, methods for the rapid, efficient and hierarchical assembly of genetic circuits from a large library of well described modular parts [8] [9] [10] [11] exist, we are unaware that such a cloning toolkit for mammalian systems is readily available. In this work, we adapted the modular cloning strategy (MoClo) 12 strategy to build mammalian expression vectors. The Mammalian ToolKit (MTK) is a library of over 300 parts including vetted promoters, 3'UTRs, fluorescent proteins, insulator and P2A elements that can be combined to build large genetic circuits in a rapid and efficient fashion. These vectors can be delivered to a wide range of cell types, through viral, recombinase and CRISPR/Cas9 methods. As a proof of concept, we built a hAAVS1 landing pad for single integration of genetic circuits, created and delivered libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs and rapidly compared multi-species Cas9-based genetic circuits. Finally, we used Ebola virus (EBOV) as a test case to address an emerging need to streamline the generation of BSL2 reagents during outbreaks of novel BSL4 viruses. Using the MTK, we rapidly built a non-infectious multicistronic ribonucleoprotein expression system for EBOV in a mammalian host. This system recapitulates the transcription and replication sub-lifecycle of the virus in a mammalian host, and can therefore be used to accelerate the study of viral biology and discovery of antiviral molecules.",A Toolkit for Rapid Modular Construction of Biological Circuits in Mammalian Cells
" B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has a dual function, acting both as an oncogene 20 and an anti-tumor gene. It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting 21 function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which 22 Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown 23 that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G 0 /G 1 to the S phase after serum 24 starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower 25 level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells.

" 24 The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a 25 chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani 26 reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite 27 also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we 28 compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. 29 donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective 30 changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions 31 by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while 32 inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel 33 quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was 34 activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by 35 polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic 36 in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) 37 and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR 38 inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting 39 corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-β decreased in presence of the 40 eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite 41 modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. 42 donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under 43 mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR-and eIF4A-44 sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. 45 donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 4 48 Author Summary 49 Fine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses 50 to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the 51 protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell 52 functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-53 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression 54 programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding 55 mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. 56 Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins 57 share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and 58 microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts 59 that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the 60 activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A 61 activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the 62 opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene 63 expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be 64 targeted for therapeutic intervention. : bioRxiv preprint 5 65 66 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne infection caused by protozoan parasites of the 67 Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) complex. VL is endemic in more than 60 countries and is 68 frequently lethal if untreated (1). The lack of efficient vaccines and the failure to control 69 emerging parasite resistance reflect the urgent need to design safe and efficient therapeutics 70 targeting host-encoded factors (2). In mammalian hosts, Leishmania promastigotes preferentially 71 colonize macrophages, where they transform into replicative amastigotes that proliferate within 72 modified phagolysosomes (1). To establish a successful infection, the parasite dampens 73 antimicrobial responses, alters vesicle trafficking, and subverts immunomodulatory functions 74 and metabolic processes of the host cell (3). 75 76 At the molecular level, L. donovani modulates the activity of multiple host cell signaling 77 pathways and transcription factors (3). Consistently, profiling of mRNA levels in L. donovani-78 infected macrophages revealed vast perturbation in host gene expression programs associated 79 with parasite persistence (4-8). The pioneering data supporting widespread changes in host cell 80 mRNA levels following L. donovani infection were obtained in bone marrow-derived 81 macrophages (BMDMs) using cDNA-microarrays (4). This study showed that L. donovani 82 axenic amastigotes downregulate expression of genes involved in apoptosis and NF-κB signaling 83 while stimulating those encoding monocyte chemoattractants. Subsequently, DNA-microarray 84 based studies of human and mouse monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L. donovani 85 promastigotes identified increased levels of transcripts related to cell migration and repression of 86 genes encoding MHC class II molecules (5, 6).

" Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in 25 several biological processes, including immune responses.

Here, we identify an 27 uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate 28 neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, 29 nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) 30 by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil 31 chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds 32 tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and 33 Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby 34 promoting TRIM25-and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling.

" Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p < 0.05). The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China.

" Background: Febrile illness is a major burden in African children, and non-malarial causes of 45 fever are uncertain. We built and employed IDseq, a cloud-based, open access, bioinformatics 46 platform and service to identify microbes from metagenomic next-generation sequencing of 47 tissue samples. In this pilot study, we evaluated blood, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens 48 from 94 children (aged 2-54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, 49 Uganda. 50 51 Results: The most common pathogens identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of 52 samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from blood; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), 53 respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; 54 and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. Among other potential pathogens, we 55 identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a 56 child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx 57 of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. 58 59 Conclusions: This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq 60 platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited 61 areas.

" Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome.

Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.",Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development

" , China, at the end of 2019, has caused at least infected 11,844 as of Feb 1, 2020. However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV. author/funder.

" The novel coronavirus , first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions"
" 288 cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.","Lessons learnt from 288 COVID-19 international cases: importations over time, effect of interventions, underdetection of imported cases"

" The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.",The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control

" The outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins.

Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins.

" An emerging disease is one infectious epidemic caused by a newly transmissible pathogen, which has either appeared for the first time or already existed in human populations, having the capacity to increase rapidly in incidence as well as geographic range. Adapting to human immune system, emerging diseases may trigger large-scale pandemic spreading, such as the transnational spreading of SARS, the global outbreak of A(H1N1), and the recent potential invasion of avian influenza A(H7N9). To study the dynamics mediating the transmission of emerging diseases, spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation provides a valuable modeling framework, which takes spatially distributed factors into consideration. This review elaborates the latest progresses on the spatial metapopulation dynamics, discusses empirical and theoretical findings that verify the validity of networked metapopulations, and the application in evaluating the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies as well.",Spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation: An overview
" While seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality each year, the community-based burden of these infections remains incompletely understood. Understanding the prevalence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory pathogen infections among community-dwelling individuals is essential during pandemic and epidemic settings and for developing pandemic-preparedness infrastructure. We present the protocol for a novel, city-wide home-based cross-sectional study in the Seattle Metropolitan area, utilizing rapid delivery systems for self-collection of a nasal swab and return to the laboratory for respiratory pathogen testing. All participation takes place electronically, including recruitment, consent, and data collection. Within 48 hours of participants self-reporting respiratory symptoms, a nasal swab kit is delivered to the household via a courier service.

" The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.",
" Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a powerful tool to understand and control plant metabolic pathways, which is central to plant biotechnology. PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells. All rights reserved.

" An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.",Predictions for the binding domain and potential new drug targets of 2019-nCoV
" Background: As of May 27, 2018, 54 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the current outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model with a negative binomial distribution, using both estimates of reproduction number R declining from supercritical to subcritical derived from past Ebola outbreaks, as well as a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the future course of the outbreak conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using 0%, 44%, and 62% estimates of vaccination coverage. Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize a regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. With the stochastic transmission model, we projected a median outbreak size of 78 EVD cases (95% credible interval: 52, 125.4), 86 cases (95% credible interval: 53, 174.3), and 91 cases (95% credible interval: 52, 843.5), using 62%, 44%, and 0% estimates of vaccination coverage.

" To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease , screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods：We collected 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%.

" For successful infection, viruses must recognize their respective host cells. A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor. Bacteriophage Sf6, which infects Shigella flexneri, uses lipopolysaccharide as a primary receptor and then requires interaction with a secondary receptor, a role that can be fulfilled by either outer membrane proteins (Omp) A or C. Our previous work showed that specific residues in the loops of OmpA mediate Sf6 infection. To better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA loop variants, we determined the kinetics of these interactions through the use of biolayer interferometry, an optical biosensing technique that yields data similar to surface plasmon resonance. Here, we successfully tethered whole Sf6 virions, determined the binding constant of Sf6 to OmpA to be 36 nM. Additionally, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs and the resulting kinetic parameters varied only slightly. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also on the ability of an Omp to induce a conformational change that results in productive infection.

" Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and prognosis is urgently needed. Dynamic changes of blood lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. A Time-LYM% model (TLM) was established according to the descriptive studies and was validated in 92 hospitalized cases. Results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood tests were inversely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. LYM% in moderate type of patients with COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Accordingly, we established a Time-LYM% model (TLM), which was validated as an independent criterion of disease classification in another 92 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Lymphopenia can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

" Cellular membranes display an incredibly diverse range of shapes, both in the plasma membrane and at membrane bound organelles. These morphologies are intricately related to cellular functions, enabling and regulating fundamental membrane processes. However, the biophysical mechanisms at the origin of these complex geometries are not fully understood from the standpoint of membrane-protein coupling. In this work, we focused on a minimal model of helicoidal ramps representative of specialized endoplasmic reticulum compartments. Given a helicoidal membrane geometry, we asked what is the distribution of spontaneous curvature required to maintain this shape at mechanical equilibrium? Based on the Helfrich energy of elastic membranes with spontaneous curvature, we derived the shape equation for minimal surfaces, and applied it to helicoids. We showed the existence of switches in the sign of the spontaneous curvature associated with geometric variations of the membrane structures. Furthermore, for a prescribed gradient of spontaneous curvature along the exterior boundaries, we identified configurations of the helicoidal ramps that are confined between two infinitely large energy barriers. Overall our results suggest possible mechanisms for geometric control of helicoidal ramps in membrane organelles based on curvatureinducing proteins.",Geometric coupling of helicoidal ramps and curvature-inducing proteins in organelle membranes
" December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping.

" Human behavior can change the spread of infectious disease. There is limited understanding of 1 how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning 2 horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE 3 analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic 4 behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence 5 with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long 6 planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, 7 individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such 8 adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, 9 depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of 10 prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially 11 generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the 12 behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual's perceived risk of infection. Human behavior plays a significant role in the dynamics of infectious disease [7, 11] . However, 15 the inclusion of behavior in epidemiological modeling introduces numerous complications and 16 involves fields of research outside the biological sciences, including psychology, philosophy, 17 sociology, and economics. Areas of research that incorporates human behavior into 18 epidemiological models are loosely referred to as social epidemiology, behavioral epidemiology, 19 or economic epidemiology [14, 17] . We use the term 'behavioral epidemiology' to broadly refer 20 to all epidemiological approaches that incorporate human behavior. While the incorporation of 21 behavior faces many challenges [9], one of the goals of behavioral epidemiology is to 22 understand how social and behavioral factors affect the dynamics of infectious disease 23 epidemics. This goal is usually accomplished by coupling models of social behavior and 24 decision making with biological models of contagion [16, 11] . Many social and behavioral aspects can be incorporated into a model of infectious disease. One example is the effect of either awareness or fear spreading through a population [10, 5] . In 27 these types of models, the spread of beliefs or information is treated as a contagion much like an 28 infectious disease, though the network for the spread of information may differ from the 29 biological network [2]. Other models focus on how individuals adapt their behavior by 30 weighting the risk of infection with the cost of social distancing [6, 19] or other disincentives [1]. 31 Still others model public health interventions (e.g. isolation, vaccination, surveillance, etc.) and 32 individual responses to them [3]. Many of these models sit at the population level, incorporating 33 the effects of social factors and abstracting away details about the individuals themselves. 34 The SPIR model (Susceptible, Prophylactic, Infectious, Recovered) is an epidemiological 35 agent-based model that couples individual behavioral decisions with an extension of the SIR 36 model [13]. In this model agents that are vulnerable to infection may be in one of two states 37 which are determined by their behavior. Agents in the susceptible state engage in the status quo 38 behavior while agents in the prophylactic state employ preventative behaviors that reduce their 39 chance of infection. We use a rational choice model to represent individual behavioral decisions, 40 where individuals select the largest utility between engaging in prophylactic behavior (e.g. hand-washing or wearing a face mask) or non-prophylactic behavior (akin to the status quo). We 42 also allow for the fact that individuals may not perceive the risk of getting infected accurately, 43 but rather receive some distorted information, for example, through the media. We are interested in understanding how an individual's planning horizon-the time in the 45 future over which individuals calculate their utilities to make a behavioral decision-affects 46 behavioral change and how that in turn influences the dynamics of an epidemic. 47 We introduce the model through the lens of individuals rather than at the population level, 48 because we find that the individualistic perspective gives a more natural interpretation of the 49 behavioral decision analysis we discuss. Under the assumption that the population is large, well 50 mixed, and homogeneous, we can also express the model as a system of ordinary differential 51 equations (ODEs). We work with both versions of the model, using the ODE version for 52 calculations, and the individual-based or agent-based model (ABM) version for thinking about 53 the psychological features of decision making that may affect the spread of infectious diseases. 54 One of our key findings is that individuals choose to engage in prophylactic behavior only 55 when the planning horizon is ""just right."" If the planning horizon is set too far into the future, it 56 is in an individual's best interest to become infected (i.e. get it over with); if the horizon is too 57 short, individuals dismiss the future risk of infection (i.e. live for the moment). What counts as 58 ""just right"" depends on the disease in question, and we explore two hypothetical contrasting 59 diseases, one with long recovery time and acute severity, and another with short recovery time 60 and mild severity. 61 Methods 62 The SPIR Model 63 The SPIR model couples two sub-models: one reproducing the dynamics of the infectious 64 disease, the Disease Dynamics Model, and another that determines how agents make the 65 decision to engage in prophylactic or non-prophylactic behavior, the Behavioral Decision Model. 66 Disease Dynamics Model 67 The disease dynamics model reproduces the dynamics of the infectious disease in a constant 68 population of N agents. Each agent can be in one of four states: Susceptible (S), Prophylactic 69 (P), Infectious (I), or Recovered (R). The difference between agents in states S and P is that the 70 former engage in non-prophylactic behavior and do not implement any measure to prevent 71 infection, while the latter adopt prophylactic behavior which decreases their probability of being 72 3/23 .

" Many mammalian carnivore species have been reduced to small, isolated populations by habitat destruction, fragmentation, poaching, and human conflict. Their limited genetic variability and increased exposure to domestic animals such as dogs place them at risk of further losses from infectious diseases. In India, domestic and feral dogs are associated with villages in and around protected areas, and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens to the carnivores within. India's Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is home to a number of threatened and endangered mammalian carnivores including tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), wolf (Canis lupus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). It also has more than 150 villages with associated dog populations. We found that dog populations ranged from 14 to 45/village (3.7 to 23.7/km 2 ), and did not vary with village area, human population size, or distance from the KTR's core area, though they all increased between summer 2014 and winter 2015, primarily through reproduction. No dog tested positive for rabies but seroprevalence levels to three other generalist viral pathogens were high in summer (N=67) and decreased somewhat by winter (N=168): canine parvovirus (83.6% to 68.4%), canine distemper virus (50.7% to 30.4%) and canine adenovirus (41.8% to 30.9%). The declines in seroprevalence were primarily due to new recruitments by birth and these were not yet exposed to the viruses. Wild carnivores frequently entered the villages, as shown by tracks, scats, kills and other indicators, and the dogs are known to leave the villages so that encounters between dogs and wild carnivores may be common. We conclude that there is a large population of unvaccinated dogs in and around Kanha Tiger Reserve, with high levels of seroprevalence to pathogens with broad host ranges and these dogs which interact with wild carnivores, therefore posing a high risk of disease spillover to the wild carnivores.","Title: Risk of disease spillover from dogs to wild carnivores in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India.

" To extend the frontier of genome editing and enable the radical redesign of mammalian genomes, we developed a set of dead-Cas9 base editor (dBE) variants that allow editing at tens of thousands of loci per cell by overcoming the cell death associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs). We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elementsranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after 5 large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded.

" The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.",China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model
" Cylindrical protein scaffolds are thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing membrane fission. In contrast, Snead et al. find that when scaffold proteins assemble, bulky disordered domains within them become acutely concentrated, generating steric pressure that destabilizes tubules, driving fission. Cellular membranes are continuously remodeled. The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysinrvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of BAR domains in isolation, the current paradigm is that they polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules, preventing membrane fission. But in nature BAR domains are often part of multi-domain proteins that contain large intrinsically-disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domaincontaining proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data challenge the idea that cellular membranes adopt the curvature of BAR scaffolds, suggesting instead that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is the key requirement for membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.

" We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.",An epidemiological forecast model and software assessing interventions on COVID-19 epidemic in China
" Spreading dynamics analysis is an important and interesting topic since it has many applications such as rumor or disease controlling, viral marketing and information recommending. Many state-of-the-art researches focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing, recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis. In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading. Experimental results on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that the model proposed could predict the infection nodes precisely in the sense of probability. Researchers have gotten many achievements on macro level of spreading such as 7 phase transition of spreading [26] and basic reproduction number [27]. Up to now, 8 many researches focus on estimating of infection scale. The simplest one is mean-field 9 model, in which, the spreading coverage can be predicted by using differential 10 equations [24]. Besides mean-field model, some more realistic models such as pair 11 approximation [25] and permutation entropy [28] are considered to predict the 12 infection scale or infectious disease outbreaks. The main difference between mean-field 13 and pair approximation is that the former(latter) approximates high-order moments in 14 term of first (second) order ones.

" The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.",A B
" Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict 36 the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. 37 Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was 38 collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on 39 the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups 40 were analyzed. 41 Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two 42 groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, 43 respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK 44 cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild 45 group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than 46 severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and 47 cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, 48 IL-6 and IL-10. 49 Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels 50 were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for 51 predicting the transition from mild to severe.

" Disease 2019. Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to ""The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)"" issued by National Health and Commission of China and ""The Experts' Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV"" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56 o C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 o C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 o C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank's solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 o C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.

" One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between 12 organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically 13 dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are 14 usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across 12 animal 15 phyla and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome composition and transcription, taking 16 into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, the ratio of introns to 17 intergenic sequence is comparable across essentially all animals, with nearly all deviations dominated by 18 increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that 19 the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit 20 substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our 21 results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences 22 in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more 23 dependent on genome size than previously thought. 24 33 34 As the number of genome projects has grown, massive amounts of data have become available to study 35 how organisms organize and use their genomes. Genome projects vary substantially in quality of assembly 36 and annotation [3, 4] . Unfortunately, the predicted genes are often taken for granted as being correct when 37 these are only hypotheses of gene structure [5]. For example, one study found that almost half of the genes 38 in the Rhesus monkey genome had a predictable annotation error when compared to the closest human 39 homolog [6]. This has profound implications for all downstream analyses, such as studying evolution of 40 1 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint orthologous proteins [7] and phylogeny based on protein matrices or gene content [8, 9]. When considered 41 across all genes, systematic errors in genome assembly or annotation would severely skew bulk parameters 42 of a genome. While issues of assembly are often thought to be technical problems that are resolved before continuing, 45 all subsequent analyses are dependent upon accurate genome assembly and annotation. The absence of a 46 protein family in a particular organism is only meaningful if it is certain that it is absent from the genome 47 and not merely the annotation, therefore it is of utmost importance that all genes are properly represented. Yet for most genome projects of non-model organisms, there are limited methods to determine if the assem-49 bly and annotation are sufficient for downstream comparative analyses. Internal metrics can be used, such 50 as the fraction of raw genomic reads or ESTs that map back to the assembly, though this does not tell us if a 51 gene is believable in the context of other animals. Alternatively, counts of ""universal"" single-copy orthologs 52 have been proposed as a metric of genome completeness [10, 11] , though these genes only represent a small 53 subset of all genes (few hundred out of tens of thousands in most animals). 54 55 Identification of universal trends in genome organization and transcription may enable better quantita-56 tive metrics of genome completeness. Mechanistic models relating to evolution of gene content or coding 57 fractions tended to focus on bacteria or archaea because of the relative ease of annotation. In regards to 58 eukaroytes, some patterns in genome size have been discussed [12-14]. Additionally, a handful of studies 59 have analyzed genome size in connection to other parameters such as indels [15], transposon content [16-19], 60 average intron length [20, 21] or total intron length [18]. Despite these advances, none of these studies have 61 estimated the amount of the genome that is genic (exonic plus intronic, including non-coding) based on in-62 dependent examination of single genomes and without averaging over a whole kingdom. Additionally, none 63 of them have described a way to account for technical problems in assembly and annotation. 64 65 Here we examine basic trends of genome size and the relationship to annotation quality across animals 66 and some single-celled eukaryotes. We show that assembly and annotation errors are widespread and pre-67 dictable and that many genomes are likely to be missing many genes. We further show that re-annotation 68 of select species with publicly available tools and transcriptome data improves the annotation. Future users 69 may benefit if databases incorporate more recent data from transcriptome sequencing, and update annota-70 tion versions more frequently. Comparison of genomic composition across many animal groups indicated a 71 ratio of introns:intergenic approaching 1:1, suggesting this as a potential parameter to identify genome com-72 pleteness across metazoans, and potentially other eukaryotes. Finally, this implies that animals transcribe 73 at least half of their genomes whereby small, exon-rich genomes transcribe most of the genome and large 74 genomes transcribe approximately half of the genome. 75 76 Methods 77 Genomic data sources 78 Data sources and parameters are available in Supplemental Table 1. 79 80 Genomic scaffolds and annotations for Ciona intestinalis [22], Branchiostoma floridae [23], Trichoplax ad-81 herens [24], Capitella teleta [25], Lottia gigantea [25], Helobdella robusta [25], Saccoglossus kowalevskii [26], 82 Monosiga brevicollis [27], Emiliania huxleyi [28], and Volvox carteri [29] were downloaded from the JGI 83 genome portal. 84 85 Genome assemblies and annotations for Sphaeroforma arctica, Capsaspora owczarzaki [30] and Salpin-86 goeca rosetta [31] were downloaded from the Broad Institute. 87 88 GFF annotations v2.1 [32] for Amphimedon queenslandica were downloaded from the Amphimedon 89 Genome website (http://amphimedon.qcloud.qcif.edu.au/downloads.html), and v1 annotations [33] and as-90 semblies were downloaded from Ensembl. 91 2 .

" Herein we describe the Archaea diversity in a shallow pond in the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), 24 Northeast Mexico, with fluctuating hypersaline conditions containing elastic microbial mats that 25 can form small domes where their anoxic inside reminds us of the characteristics of the Archaean 26 Eon, rich in methane and sulfur gases; thus, we named this site the Archaean Domes (AD). These 27 domes only form after heavy rains that are rare in the Chihuahuan desert. CCB is a unique oasis 28 with hundreds of ponds, containing endemic species of animals, plants and highly diverse and 29 unique microbial communities, despite its very biased stoichiometry, due mostly to extreme low 30 phosphorus content (soils, water columns and sediments). This extreme oligotrophy has favored 31 survival of ancestral microorganisms. Whole metagenome sequencing approach was performed for 32 this unusual site in three different seasons to assess the extent of the Archaea biodiversity, with a 33 focus on extremophiles, since members of the Archaea had been underrepresented in different study 34 sites within the oasis. We found a highly diverse Archaea community compassing ~5% of the 35 metagenomes. The archaeal portion in all three metagenomes maintained its abundance and most of 36 the strains showed to form a resilient core during three seasonal samplings (2016-2017), despite 37 environmental fluctuations. However, relative abundances of all 230 archaeal OTUs (defined using 38 a 97% cutoff) were low enough (<0.1%) to be considered part of the rare biosphere. AD finding and 39 their description within CCB confirms that this particular pond is the most diverse for Archaea that 40 we are aware of and opens new paths for understanding the forces that once drove and keep shaping 41 microbial community assemblage. 42 43 44 45 .

CCB biodiversity is believed to have evolved as a 71 result of a long time environmental stability of a deep aquifer [29], as suggested by the marine 72 affiliations in many of the studied bacterial genomes [25, 30], virus [31], and probably, Archaea. 73 These observations led CCB scientists to raise hypothesis and propose CCB as a model of ""lost 74 world"", where extreme conditions favored the survival of ancestral marine lineages that in some 75 cases persist exclusively in this area [32]. Nevertheless, Archaea in CCB has been poorly studied 76 since they were underrepresented in previous metagenomic studies [24, 28, 33, 34]. 77 During a late March 2016 field work, an atypical spring rain apparently dissolved the salty 78 crust of an unnoticed shallow pond, allowing the uniquely flexible and impermeable microbial mats 79 to arise from the ground building bubbles, or domes with a strong sulfur-like smell. Our hypothesis 80 was that gas production of methanogenic as well as other microorganisms associated to the sulfur 81 cycle were degassing creating a locally anaerobic atmosphere. Therefore, the anaerobic layer of the 82 microbial mats were creating the domes by raising the flexible and impermeable mat where 83 photosynthesis was evident given the purple, and green layers, creating an unique ""alien"" local 84 landscape ( Figure 1 ).

" MicroRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are short hairpin RNAs that are rapidly processed into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cytoplasm. Due to their low abundance in cells, sequencing-based studies of pre-miRNAs have been limited. We successfully enriched for and deep sequenced pre-miRNAs in human cells by capturing these RNAs during their interaction with Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Using this approach, we detected > 350 pre-miRNAs in human cells and > 250 pre-miRNAs in a reanalysis of a similar study in mouse cells. We uncovered widespread trimming and non-templated additions to the 3' ends of pre-and mature miRNAs. Additionally, we created an index for microRNA precursor processing efficiency. This analysis revealed a subset of pre-miRNAs that produce low levels of mature miRNAs despite abundant precursors, including an annotated miRNA in the 5' UTR of the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 mRNA transcript. This led us to search for AGO-associated stem-loops originating from other mRNA species, which identified hundreds of putative pre-miRNAs derived from human and mouse mRNAs. In summary, we provide a wealth of information on mammalian pre-miRNAs, and identify novel microRNA and microRNA-like elements localized in mRNAs.",TITLE: Isolation and sequencing of AGO-bound RNAs reveals characteristics of mammalian stem-loop processing in vivo AUTHORS
" Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.",Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19
" Early in planta detection of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae in pomegranate using 2 enhanced loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay 3 4 Abstract 33 Bacterial blight in pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) is an 34 increasing threat for pomegranate cultivation in India. To prevent the economic losses, it is pivotal 35 to detect the infection in latent stages rather than in later stages. We have developed an enhanced 36 method termed as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to evaluate for the 37 latent detection of Xap in pomegranate using six set of specific primers. Three DNA intercalating 38 dyes were used, such as Ethidium bromide, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and SYBR Green which 39 resulted in visualising the positivity for LAMP assay. The reaction time and temperature were to 40 be 65°C from 30 min onwards, for the dyes and its sensitivity was observed up to 10 -7 ng in the 41 LAMP assay. For field applicability, LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day post infection while the 42 PCR amplified Xap after 11 th day post infection. Finally, the specificity of LAMP assay was 43 validated to be positive with ten Xap isolates for its accuracy and 29 non-Xap bacterial isolates 44 showed negative results. Moreover, this method could be used as a better alternative to PCR based 45 methods, for early detection of the pathogens. 46 47 50 Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an important fruit crop widely cultivated from tropical to 51 temperate conditions [1]. India ranks first in the world for maximum area under pomegranate 52 cultivation (0.125 million hectares) and Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major 53 pomegranate growing states [2]. The bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. 54 punicae (Xap) in pomegranate was first reported in India in 1952 and presently it has a serious 55 outbreak in all major pomegranate-growing states resulting in a major economic loss. Prominent 56 small water-soaked and dark irregular spots appearing on the leaf are the typical symptoms induced 57 by this pathogen. The pathogen infect the fruit, stem, branches causing cracking symptoms and 58 ultimately leads to yield loss up to 80 percent [3]. .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint 59 Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40% of the crop cultivated gets destroyed 60 annually due to pests and diseases [4]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 61 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important 62 and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time 63 of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) 64 [5,6]. 65 The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include 66 immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [7] and molecular 67 methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [8] and Southern blotting [9]. The methods for 68 early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be 69 competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment 70 facilities [10]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high 71 quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for 72 changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process 73 to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm 74 the amplification [11]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in 75 developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal 76 amplification (LAMP) [12]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis 77 technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. 78 The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65º C, which 79 can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [13]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective 80 and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as 81 positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending 82 much time [14]. 83 The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal 84 RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different 85 bacteria [15-17]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their 86 nine (V1 -V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [18]. These regions are 87 highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize 90 eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [20]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 91 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These 92 six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable 93 generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-94 priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop 95 is produced as a final product [21]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely 96 used to detect broad range of microorganisms[22,23]. The present study was aimed to detect the 97 bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by 98 optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less 99 technical skills. 100 MATERIALS AND METHODS Source of bacterial blight material used for the study 102 Ten Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) isolates collected from four different regions of 103 Karnataka, India were used in this study (Fig 1) . Additionally, we have also isolated 29 non-104 Xanthomonas bacteria from pomegranate Table 1 . The pure culture Xap isolates were maintained 105 in a Nutrient Broth for 72 hours and the DNA was extracted using crude method. The quality and 106 quantity of the DNA were determined using Nanodrop (Model -DS-11 FX +, DeNovix, USA).",
" Clean freshwater lies at the heart of human society and monitoring its quality is paramount. In addition to chemical controls, traditional microbiological water tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial pathogens. The direct tracing of all aquatic DNA poses a more profound alternative. Yet, this has hitherto been underused due to challenges in cost and logistics. Here we present a simple, fast, inexpensive and comprehensive freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around portable nanopore DNA sequencing. Using defined bacterial compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), our study shows how nanopore sequencing can be readily integrated for the assessment of aquatic bacterial diversity and pollution. We provide a computational benchmark that features more than ten taxonomic classification tools to derive guidelines for bacterial DNA analyses with nanopore data. Through complementary physicochemical measurements, we find that nanopore metagenomics can depict fine temporal gradients along the main hydrological axis of an urban-rural interface and yield high-resolution pathogen maps that address concerns of public health.",Freshwater monitoring by nanopore sequencing
" As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed.

" The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",Title: Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019 Brief Title: Antibody responses in COVID-19 patients Summary Background
" We give an update to the original paper posted on 2/17/20 -now (as of 3/1/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of Vazquez [2006]. At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.",Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic (with update 3/1/20)
" Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways.

" A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.",Reconciling early-outbreak estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak

We examined the 'metavirome' of four populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016-2017 from Manatee County, Florida. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a two-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, as well as explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of these DENV4 infections in Ae. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States (U.S.) involving local transmission have occurred episodically and only in Florida and Texas.

" 1. Predicting infectious disease dynamics is a central challenge in disease ecology. Models 36 that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only 37 provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide 38 management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, 39 however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset 40 of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common. 41 42 2. Here we take advantage of the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct 43 pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex non-linear relationships 44 with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing values. Our 45 approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to 46 find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better 47 interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African 48 lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus. 49 50 3. Our modelling approach provided enhanced predictive performance compared to more 51 traditional approaches, as well as new insights into disease risks in a wild population. We 52 were able to efficiently capture and visualise strong non-linear patterns, as well as model 53 complex interactions between variables in shaping exposure risk from CDV and feline 54 parvovirus.

" RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive environment). A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique featuresimpressive in themselvesattest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery. author/funder.

" Background The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID-19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Methods Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R t ) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings We estimated that R t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards",Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China
" The viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides presented by classical MHC-I 13 molecules require the assembly of a peptide-MHC-I-β2m (aka pMHC-I) trimolecular complex 14 for TCR recognition, which is the critical activation link for triggering antiviral T cell immunity. 15 Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, 16 especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular 17 complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved 18 for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural 19 characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the 20 peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others 21 in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. 22 Spriggs H, Dear PH, Briggs AW. 2008.

" The basic reproductive number -R 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R 0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R 0 . Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R 0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R 0 ) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R 0 when predicting epidemic size.",Beyond R 0 : the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics
" Host plasma membrane protein SERINC5 is incorporated into budding retrovirus particles where it blocks subsequent entry into susceptible target cells. Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7 + endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV) glycoproteins were sensitive to SERINC5, but only with particular retroviral cores. Resistance to SERINC5 by particular glycoproteins did not correlate with reduced SERINC5 incorporation into particles or with the route of viral entry. These findings indicate that some non-retroviruses may be sensitive to SERINC5 and that, in addition to the viral glycoprotein, the retroviral core influences sensitivity to SERINC5.",Influence of different glycoproteins and of the virion core on SERINC5 antiviral activity
" Primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures represent a universal platform to 20 propagate respiratory viruses and characterize their host interactions in authentic target cells. To 21 further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors 22 in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. 23 However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the 24 genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the 25 Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life 26 span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based 27 expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated 28 homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As 29 proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation 30 via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of 31 these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, 32 demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, 33 the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory 34 syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected.

" Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.",Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model
" Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 . Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å in the presence of B 0 AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 Å, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses. author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 -328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 -363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a 3 key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate 4 medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM 5 structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the 6 trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible 7 conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds 8 ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-9 CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 10 nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. 11 The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation",Cryo-EM Structure of the 2019-nCoV Spike in the Prefusion Conformation
" G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of putative G-quadruplexes in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that the presence, distribution, and location of G-quadruplexes are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the G-quadruplex classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all G-quadruplexes formed by GG-, GGG-and GGGG-islands present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome along with the known function of that region, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each G-quadruplex in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of G-quadruplex formation.

" Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 .

The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.","Title: The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated"
" The Mad1-Mad2 heterodimer is the catalytic hub of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which controls mitosis through assembly of a multi-subunit anaphase inhibitor, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) [1, 2] . Mad1-Mad2 first catalyzes MCC assembly at interphase nuclear pores [3] , then migrates to kinetochores at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and resumes MCC assembly until bipolar spindle attachment is complete [1, 2] . There is significant debate about the factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Through gene editing and livecell imaging, we found that the human Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is dispensable for cell viability and initial recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores at NEBD, but then becomes necessary to tether Mad1-Mad2 at kinetochores and sustain SAC arrest in cells challenged with spindle poisons. We also show that RZZ forms the mesh-like fibrous corona, a structural expansion of the outer kinetochore important for timely chromosome congression [10-13] once Mps1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Rod. Artificially tethering Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores enabled long-term mitotic arrest in the absence of RZZ. Conversely, blocking early RZZ-independent recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 eliminated the transient SAC response in RZZ-null cells. We conclude that RZZ drives structural changes in the outer kinetochore that facilitate chromosome biorientation and chronic SAC transduction, a key determinant of cytotoxicity during antimitotic drug therapy [14-16].

Results Recent studies have reached different conclusions about the specific roles and relative importance of Bub1 and the RZZ complex in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores and transducing SAC arrest [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . To interrogate RZZ function with maximum penetrance, we used AAV (adeno-associated virus)-and CRISPR-mediated gene editing to target the KNTC1 (Rod) locus in HCT116 cells, a diploid colorectal cell line ( Fig. S1A-C) . The resulting KNTC1 HF/-(hypomorph-flox) cells expressed Rod at ~20% of the wildtype level ( Fig. 1A -B and S1D) and exited mitosis prematurely when microtubule polymerization (nocodazole, 99 ± 6 min s.e.m.) or Eg5-dependent spindle bipolarity (S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), 193 ± 9 min s.e.m.) were inhibited, whereas wildtype cells never exited mitosis during the 16-hour timelapse (Fig. 1A-B) . To determine if complete loss of the RZZ complex is compatible with clonogenic survival, KNTC1 HF/cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) and subjected to limiting dilution.",The RZZ complex integrates spindle checkpoint maintenance with dynamic expansion of unattached kinetochores
" BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.

" The nasopharynx (NP) is a reservoir for microbes associated with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI). The development of asthma is initiated during infancy, driven by airway inflammation associated with infections. Here, we report viral and bacterial community profiling of NP aspirates across a birth cohort, capturing all lower respiratory illnesses during their first year. Most infants were initially colonized with Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium before stable colonization with Alloiococcus or Moraxella, with transient incursions of Streptococcus, Moraxella or Haemophilus marking virus-associated ARIs. Our data identify the NP microbiome as a determinant for infection spread to the lower airways, severity of accompanying inflammatory symptoms, and risk for future asthma development. Early asymptomatic colonization with Streptococcus was a strong asthma predictor, and antibiotic usage disrupted asymptomatic colonization patterns. doi: bioRxiv preprint (154/782) of recorded episodes of upper respiratory illness (URI). The characteristics of the infants are summarized in Table S1 . Across all NP samples, more than 193 million high quality 16S rRNA sequences were classified into 14,131 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of which 1,010 were supported by >1,000 reads each. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (48%), Firmicutes (38%), Actinobacteria (13%), Bacteroidetes (1%) and Fusobacteria (0.5%) (Fig. 1A) . The NP microbiomes were dominated by six genera -Moraxella (31.2%), Streptococcus (15.5%), Corynebacterium (13.5%), Staphylococcus (10.3%), Haemophilus (9.7%) and Alloiococcus (8.8%; grouped under genus Dolosigranulum in some databases) (Error! Reference source not found.A). Despite the inclusion of diverse OTUs of these genera in the Greengenes reference database (138 Moraxella; 2,361 Streptococcus; 1,592 Corynebacterium; 1,936 Staphylococcus; 684 Haemophilus; 82 Alloiococcus), our sequences were dominated by one OTU per genus ( Fig. S1-6) , consistent with culture-based studies reporting NP colonization with the species Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Alloiococcus otitidis. Hierarchical clustering of NP microbiomes based on relative abundance of the six major genera identified six microbiome profile groups (MPGs, Fig. 1B) . Each MPG was dominated by one of the six genera, although some samples in the Alloiococcus MPG also had relatively high abundance of Corynebacterium (Fig. 1B) . The distribution of other rarer OTUs, including those of Neisseria, Pseudomonas, Veillonella, Gemella, Rothia and Prevotella, is shown in Fig. S7 . Healthy NP samples collected around 2 months of age were dominated by the Staphylococcus (41%) and Corynebacterium (22%) MPGs, but the frequency of these MPGs declined with age (11% and 10%, respectively, at 12 months old) (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, the prevalence of Alloiococcus and Moraxella MPGs in healthy samples increased with age (14% and 9% at 2 months, 26% and 41% at 12 months, respectively). Analysis of MPG transitions amongst consecutive healthy NP samples from the same individuals ( Fig. S8A-B) suggested that Staphylococcus carriage was unstable or transient, particularly where an ARI had occurred in the intervening period between sampling. Alloiococcus was a stable colonizer, but less so if an ARI occurred between sampling. Where an ARI occurred in the intervening period between healthy samples, the most common transitions were to the Moraxella MPG from other MPGs, or the maintenance of stable colonization with Moraxella (Fig.  S8B) . Almost all Moraxella-colonized infants experienced subsequent ARI before the next healthy sample was taken; this is explored further below. Haemophilus was very rarely detected in healthy NP microbiomes, while Streptococcus was present in 14% of healthy samples at each of the 2, 6 and 12 month sampling times (Fig. 1C) . Similar age-related patterns were observed amongst infection samples, with a decline in Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium MPGs and increase in Moraxella, Haemophilus and Streptococcus MPGs in older children (Fig. 1D) . Interestingly, boys had significantly more Moraxella in healthy samples (OR 1.3 for log abundance; 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.0014, adjusted for age); no other gender effects were detected. We next assessed the impact of environmental factors on the relative abundance of the common NP microbiome genera. We found no significant effects of delivery mode or .

" To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.",Title: Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts
" For understanding the evolution of social behavior in microbes, mathematical theory can aid empirical research but is often only used as a qualitative heuristic. How to properly formulate social evolution theory has also been contentious. Here we evaluate kin and multilevel selection theory as tools for analyzing microbial data. We reanalyze published datasets that share a common exper-5 imental design and evaluate these theories in terms of data visualization, statistical performance, biological interpretation, and quantitative comparison across systems. We find that the canonical formulations of both kin and multilevel selection are almost always poor analytical tools because they use statistical regressions that are poorly specified for the strong selection and nonadditive fitness effects common in microbial systems. Analyzing both individual and group fitness outcomes 10 helps clarify the biology of selection. We also identify analytical practices in empirical research that suggest how theory might better handle the challenges of microbial data. A quantitative, data-driven approach thus shows how kin and multilevel selection theory both have substantial room for improvement as tools for understanding social evolution in all branches of life.",Kin and group selection are both flawed but useful data analysis tools
" Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor 2 binding in a new host. Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already 3 harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that 4 additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming 5 host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that 6 the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate 7 infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show 8 that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human 9 lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike 10 does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike 11 receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a 13 second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of 14 the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate 16 emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic 17 CoV strains. 18 Importance Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a 20 subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding 21 and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating 22 the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also 23 offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue 24 that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence 25 events in humans.",Trypsin treatment unlocks barrier for zoonotic coronaviruses infection.

" Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.",A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China
" Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies 19 implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but 20 the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-21 guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the 22 ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 23 processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type 26 virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively 28 regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type 29 virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that 33 PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. 34 Importance Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that 36 function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune 37 response.

To 40 separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis 41 approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating 42 the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease 43 activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed 44 that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and 45 exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is 46 an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses. 47 48 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses 49 with large (~30kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested 50 set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1, 2). The genome 51 organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5'-most two-thirds of the genome 52 encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural 53 proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes, 54 which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes 55 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within 56 the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3). Interestingly, 57 coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or 58 delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, 4-8). That a slew of coronavirus-encoded 59 accessory and non-accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response 60 suggests that viral-mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection.

Coronavirus proteases are essential for viral replication as they are responsible for processing 64 the replicase polyprotein (2,(9)(10)(11). Murine coronavirus MHV encodes three proteases: two 65 papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) and one chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also termed 66 Mpro). MHV PLP2 is similar to the single papain-like protease (termed PLpro) of Severe Acute 67 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 68 Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (9, 12-16). We and others have revealed that PLP2 or PLpro of 69 multiple coronaviruses, including MHV, are multifunctional, not only capable of cleaving the viral 70 polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylating (de-conjugating ISG15 71 molecule from modified substrates) activities (9, 12, 13, 15-27). However, it has been challenging 72 to study the effects of a mutated DUB on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease 73 and DUB activities share the same catalytic site, disruption of which is lethal for virus replication. 74 Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify residue(s) within the MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin 75 binding surface that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 76 processing. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided identification of such residues 77 and evaluate the replication, IFN antagonistic effect, and pathogenesis of a recombinant DUB 78 mutant MHV. 79 Results Structure-guided identification of PLP2 residues interacting with ubiquitin.

X-ray structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs co-85 crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo- 86 propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct 87 interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20). Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the 88 catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-crystallized it with free 89 ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin was determined 90 to a resolution of 1.85 Å and an overall Rfree = 19.6% and Rwork = 15.8% (PDB: 5WFI). The overall 91 structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound 92 structures (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc-fingers 93 motif while the C-terminus extends into the active site. 94 Next, we aligned the primary amino acid sequence of the MHV PLP2 domain with the 95 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease domains (Fig. 1E) . The sequence alignment and 96 X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex were then analyzed in conjunction with the 97 previous structural and mutagenesis studies on SARS-and MERS-CoV to identify candidate 98 residues that could be mutated to render a loss of DUB activity in vitro. From this analysis, we 99 identified three residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with 100 ubiquitin (Fig. 1B-D) . Two of the side chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen 101 bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B) . The two side chain 102 carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with 103 each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig.   104 1C). Finally, F1812 forms Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of I44 and V70 and the 105 delta-carbon of R42 of ubiquitin (Fig. 1D) . 106 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. To identify a mutant MHV PLP2 enzyme that 107 retains protease activity but exhibits reduced DUB and/or deISGylating activity, we performed 108 site-directed mutagenesis on each of the residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) by changing each to an 109 alanine to disrupt interactions with ubiquitin. Each mutant enzyme was expressed, purified, and 110 tested for its ability to hydrolyze three substrates: z-RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC. The activity of each mutant enzyme toward each substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme is 112 shown in Fig. 2A . All three mutants retained their ability to hydrolyze the peptide substrate but 113 each mutant had altered specificity toward Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates. Mutation of 114 F1812 resulted in a substantial decrease in hydrolysis of both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (Class 115 I), whereas mutation of R1803 resulted in loss of activity only toward ISG15-AMC (Class II), and 116 mutation of D1772 resulted in loss of activity only toward Ub-AMC (Class III). 117 151 All rights reserved.

The membrane 338 was incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Life Technologies) for 339 the protease assay, or mouse anti-flag (F3165, Sigma) for the DUB assay. The membrane was then 340 washed three times for 15 minutes in TBST buffer followed by incubation with either secondary 341 donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (711-035-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse-342 HRP antibody (1010-05, SouthernBiotech). Then the membrane was washed three more times for 343 15 minutes in TBST buffer. Detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence 344 Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) and visualized using a FluoroChemE Imager (Protein Simple).

Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high 30 perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily 31 routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 32 Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease 33 progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast 34 (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 35 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal 36 hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered 37 effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers 38 for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New 39 Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and 40 being more anxious (aOR:1.07). 41 42 Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high.

" In solid tumors, increasing drug penetration promotes their regression and improves the therapeutic index of compounds. However, the heterogeneous extracellular matrix (ECM) acts a steric and interaction barrier that hinders effective transport of therapeutics, including nanomedicines. Specifically, the interactions between the ECM and surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity) impedes their diffusion and penetration. To address the challenges using existing surface chemistries, we used peptide-presenting phage libraries as a high-throughput approach to screen and identify peptides as coatings with desired physicochemical properties that improve diffusive transport through the tumor microenvironment. Through iterative screening against the ECM and identification by next-generation DNA sequencing and analysis, we selected individual clones and measured their transport by diffusion assays.

" Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin.

" Influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) cause yearly epidemics with significant 25 morbidity and mortality. When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral 26 hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In 27 contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. 28 Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address 29 this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses 30 (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the 31 mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation 32 of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein 33 enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to 34 IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with 35 much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was 36 sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. 37 Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception 38 being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33°C, a temperature 39 required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of 40 IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These 41 distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation 42 during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population. 43 2 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Importance Influenza epidemics are caused by influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses. IBV causes 45 substantial disease, however it is far less studied than IAV. While IAV originates from animal 46 reservoirs, IBV circulates in humans only. Virus spread requires that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) 47 is active and sufficiently stable in human airways. We here resolve how these mechanisms differ 48 between IBV and IAV. Whereas human IAVs rely on one particular protease for HA activation, this 49 is not the case for IBV. Superior activation of IBV by several proteases should enhance shedding 50 of infectious particles. IBV HA exhibits acid-stability and a preference for 33°C, indicating 51 pronounced adaptation to the human upper airways, where the pH is mildly acidic and a cooler 52 temperature exists. These adaptive features are rationalized by the long existence of IBV in 53 humans, and may have broader relevance for understanding the biology and evolution of 54 respiratory viruses. 55 3 All rights reserved.

Gene reassortment between the two lineages is common yet 66 not seen for the HA, PB1 and PB2 gene segments (7). Whereas IAV is widespread in 67 birds and mammals (8), IBV is restricted to humans with no sustained animal reservoir (9) 68 and only rare spillover events (10). When a zoonotic IAV enters the human population, 69 adaptive changes in multiple viral proteins are required to achieve sustained human-to-70 human transmissibility (11). Which adaptive features were acquired by IBV as a result of 71 its long existence in humans has hardly been investigated (9). 72 73 One major protein involved in this host adaptation is the viral hemagglutinin (HA), the 74 mediator of viral entry (12, 13). HA binds to sialylated glycans on the cell surface to enable 75 virus uptake by endocytosis. Next, HA mediates fusion of the viral envelope and 76 endosomal membrane, allowing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. 77 Membrane fusion occurs when virus-containing endosomes mature from early (pH ~6) to 78 4 All rights reserved.

To gain membrane fusion-competence, HA relies on 80 host cell proteases for posttranslational cleavage of the HA0 precursor into two 81 polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, a process termed priming or activation (15). In human IAV 82 and IBV strains, HA0 has a monobasic (single arginine) cleavage site that is recognized 83 by trypsin-like serine proteases. Understanding the protease dependency of HA might 84 reveal biological differences between IAV and IBV, and direct drug concepts to target 85 these proteases for influenza therapy (16, 17). A series of proteases have been proposed 86 for IAV (reviewed by Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. (18)), but for IBV hardly any 87 information is available. The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 88 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is an activator of IAV HA0 in cell culture and essential 89 for IAV replication in mice, at least for some IAV subtypes (19-22). In humans, a gene 90 polymorphism leading to higher TMPRSS2 expression was correlated with the risk for 91 developing severe influenza (23). In cell culture, IAV can also be activated by some other 92 TTSPs and kallikreins, but which of these support spread of IAV in human airways remains 93 to be demonstrated [reviewed in: (16, 24)]. Regarding IBV, TMPRSS2 was shown to 94 cleave IBV HA0 (17) and mediate virus spread in some human airway cell culture models 95 (25), however this protease appeared dispensable for IBV pathogenesis in mice (26). 96 Hence, the protease recognition profile of IBV HA is largely unknown. 97 98 Two other adaptive features of HA are related to its pH-and temperature-dependence. 99 Again, data for IBV are very limited. Successful virus replication and transmission require 100 a balance between the low pH that triggers HA refolding and membrane fusion during viral 101 entry, and acid-stability of progeny virus in the respiratory tract and environment (27, 28). 102 5 All rights reserved.

" In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources -Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive -to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic.

The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days.

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others.

" The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.",Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China

ABSTRACT 23 The 3¢-to-5¢ exoribonuclease in coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) 24 mediates RNA proofreading during genome replication. ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in 25 three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four 26 nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants 27 with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. 28 Despite these impairments, MHV-and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have 29 not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound 30 fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA 31 with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show 32 that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or 33 competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-34 AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. 35 Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-36 adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while 37 reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than 38 intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to 39 fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate 40 potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at 41 stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. 42 43 All rights reserved.

We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term 50 passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a 51 reverted ExoN.

" Objective: To compare the difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and figure out the potential symptoms lead to severity. Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.",Comparison of severe and non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia: review and meta-analysis
" With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to 8 prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV). Previously, groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a 11 conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, 16 combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, 18 and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. .

We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age.

" Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape. 4 conclude that HOPS allows CPMPs to traffic into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), a favorable environment for endosomal escape. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes. RESULTS The simplest way for a CPMP to escape from an endosome is if the endosome ruptures, in part or in full (25). Although there has been limited work on the effects of certain CPPs on the integrity of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) in vitro (26), the concentration-dependent effects of CPMPs or more traditional cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) on endosomal integrity in cultured cells have not been thoroughly evaluated. Thus, we began our analysis with two complementary assays that together detect both subtle and severe endosomal damage in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. One assay exploits a set of eGFP-labeled galectins to fluorescently tag damaged endosomes to enable their visualization using confocal microscopy, while the other employs a fluorescently tagged version of the nonalysine (Lys9) peptide to quantify the extent of endosome rupture in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. In both cases, the effects of the two most efficient CPMPs-aPP5.3 (1) and ZF5.3 (2)-were compared with those of prototypic members of three CPP families: the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8 (3) (22); Doctaarginine (D-Arg8, 4) (27), and a cyclic peptide containing both natural and unnatural amino acids, CPP12 (5) (26) (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). SAH-p53-8 (3) is a hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that reaches the cell interior despite the absence of excess positive charge, D-octaarginine is the proteolytically stable enantiomer of the widely studied octapeptide L-Arg8 (27, 28), and CPP12 (5) is a cyclic peptide that reportedly reaches the cytosol with an efficiency that rivals aPP5.3 (26). A characteristic feature of endosomes that have been damaged by invading viruses (29, 30), bacteria-triggered autophagy (31-34), or endosomolytic nanoparticles (35) is the cytosolic display of β-galactosides linked to proteoglycans that are ordinarily found on the luminal side of endolysosomal compartments (36). Once displayed to the cytosol, β-galactosides recruit cytosolic galectin (Gal) proteins (37, 38), such as Gal1, 3, 4, 8, and 9, that share a conserved βgalactoside binding site ( Figure S2A ) (39, 40). In particular, Gal3 and Gal8 are recruited to damaged Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that form along the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway (33, 40). Previous work has shown that endosomal damage can be detected by monitoring the translocation of eGFP fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 from the cytosol to endosome surfaces (29-34). Fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 and eGFP have also been used to visualize late endosome damage upon siRNA release from endosomes (40), screen for small molecules that induce lysosomal rupture (41), visualize endosomal leakage induced by osmocytosis and .

" Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs.

" Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28 th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.","National Natural Science Foundation of China (81970071), the Special Project for Emergency of the Ministry of Science and Technology (2020YFC0841300), the Special Project of Guangdong Science and Technology Department"
" The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.",Gene birth contributes to structural disorder encoded by overlapping genes

" Transmission between hosts is a critical part of the viral lifecycle. Recent studies of viral transmission have 9 used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role 10 of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data 11 describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive frame-12 work for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events. Our model describes 13 transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than independent alleles. We demonstrate how 14 selection and noisy sequence data may each affect inferences of the population bottleneck, and identify 15 circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified. Applying 16 our model to data from a previous experimental transmission study, we show that our approach grants a 17 more quantitative insight into viral transmission, inferring that between 2 to 6 viruses initiated infection, 18 and allowing for a more informed interpretation of transmission events. While our model is here applied 19 to influenza transmission, the framework we present is highly generalisable to other systems. Our work 20 provides new opportunities for studying viral transmission. 21 Introduction Understanding viral transmission is a key task for viral epidemiology. The extent to which a virus is able 23 to transmit between hosts determines whether it is likely to cause sporadic, local outbreaks, or spread 24 to cause a global pandemic [1, 2]. In a transmission event, the transmission bottleneck, which specifies 25 the number of viral particles founding a new infection, influences the amount of genetic diversity that is 26 retained upon transmission, with important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of the virus [3,4]. Recent studies have used genome sequencing approaches to study transmission bottlenecks in influenza 29 populations. In small animal studies, the use of neutral genetic markers has shown that the transmission 30 bottleneck is dependent upon the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission [5,6]. 31 In natural human influenza populations, where modification of the virus is not possible, population genetic 32 methods have been used to analyse bottleneck sizes. Analyses of transmission have employed different 33 approaches, exploiting the observation or non-observation of variant alleles [7] or using changes in allele 34 frequencies to characterise the bottleneck under a model of genetic drift [8-11]. A recent publication 35 improved this latter model, incorporating the uncertainty imposed upon allele frequencies by the process 36 of within-host growth [12]. Two studies of within-household influenza transmission have provided strik-37 ingly different outcomes in the number of viruses involved in transmission, with estimates of 1-2 [13] and 38 100-200 [14] respectively. 39 40 Another focus of research has been the role of selection during a transmission event; this is important 41 in the context of the potential for new influenza strains to become transmissible between mammalian 42 hosts [15, 16]. Studies examining transmissibility have assessed the potential for different strains of in-43 fluenza to achieve droplet transmission between ferrets under laboratory conditions [17-20]; ferrets provide 44 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/302331 doi: bioRxiv preprint a useful, if imperfect, model for transmission between humans [21, 22]. The application of bioinformatic 45 techniques to data from these experiments has identified 'selective bottlenecks' in the experimental evolu-46 tion of these viruses [23, 24], whereby some genetic variants appear to be more transmissible than others. In these studies, selection has been considered in terms of the population diversity statistic π; changes 48 in π N /π S , the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous diversity, have been used to evaluate 49 patterns of selection across different viral segments. 50 51 We here note the need for a greater clarity of thinking in the analysis of viral transmission events. For 52 example, analysis of genetic variants in viral populations shows that synonymous and non-synonymous 53 mutations both have fitness consequences for viruses [25, 26]; the use of synonymous variants as a neu-54 tral reference set may not hold. More fundamentally, in an event where the effective population size is 55 small, the influences of selection and genetic drift may be of similar magnitude [27]. However selection 56 is assessed, this implies a need to separate stochastic changes in a population from selection, especially 57 where a transmission bottleneck may include only a small number of viruses [5, 13, 28]. The attribution 58 of a change in diversity to the action of selection or the attribution of changes in allele frequencies to 59 genetic drift could both potentially be flawed. Given the increasing availability of sequence data, more 60 sophisticated tools for the analysis of viral transmission are required. 61 62 Here we note three challenges in the analysis of data from viral transmission events. Firstly, selection 63 can produce changes in a population equivalent to those arising through a neutral population bottle-64 neck [29] (Figure 1A), making it necessary to distinguish between the two scenarios. A broad literature 65 has considered the simultaneous inference of the magnitude of selection acting upon a variant along with 66 an effective population size [30-35]. However, such approaches rely on the observation of an allele fre-67 quency at more than two time points so as to distinguish a deterministic model of selection (with an 68 implied infinite effective population size) from a combined model of selection with genetic drift; such 69 approaches cannot be directly applied to the analysis of viral transmission. 70 71 Secondly, inferences of transmission events need to account for the haplotype structure of viral pop-72 ulations, whereby whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles, are transmitted (Figure 1B). 73 The low rate of homologous recombination in segments of the influenza virus [36, 37] implies that viral 74 evolution proceeds at the haplotype level [38]; competition occurs between collections of linked alleles, or 75 segments, rather than the individual alleles themselves. Under such circumstances, fitter variants do not 76 always increase in frequency within a population [39-41]. Calculations of genetic drift, which are often 77 derived from the evolution of independent variants [42], need to be adjusted to account for this more 78 complex dynamics. 79 80 Thirdly, noise in the measurement of a population may influence the inferred size of a transmission 81 bottleneck (Figure 1C). A broad range of studies have examined the effect of noise in variant calling 82 and genome sequence analysis [43-50]; more recently formulae have been proposed to measure the preci-83 sion with which allele frequencies can be defined given samples from a population [51-53]. Where small 84 changes in allele frequencies are used to assess a population bottleneck, it is important to separate the 85 effects of noise in the measurement of populations from genuine changes in a population. 86 87 We here describe a novel method for the inference of population bottlenecks which resolves the above 88 issues. Our approach correctly evaluates changes in a population even where the data describing that 89 change is affected by noise. It explicitly accounts for the haplotype structure of a population, utilising the 90 data present within short sequence reads. Further, where these factors can be discriminated, our method 91 distinguishes between the influences on the population of selection and the transmission bottleneck. 92 Studies of viral evolution have highlighted the potential for payoffs between within-host viral growth and 93 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/302331 doi: bioRxiv preprint transmissibility [54]; given sufficient data we can evaluate how selection operates upon each of these two 94 phenotypes. Our model extends previous population genetic work on bottleneck inference to provide a 95 generalised model for the analysis of data spanning viral transmission events. 96 Results 97 Model outline 98 In the recent literature, the term 'bottleneck' has been applied to describe a reduction in the genetic 99 diversity of a population (e.g. [55]), whether arising from selection or a numerical reduction in the size of 100 a population. Here, we define a 'bottleneck' more strictly as a neutral process whereby a finite number 101 of viral particles from one population found a subsequent generation of the population, either within the 102 same host, or across a transmission event from host to recipient. Selection then constitutes a modification 103 to this process whereby some viruses, because of their genotype, have a higher or lower probability of 104 making it through the bottleneck to found the next generation. We applied a population genetic method to make a joint inference of the bottleneck size and the 107 extent of selection acting during a transmission event. We consider a scenario in which a viral population 108 is transmitted from one host to another, with samples being collected before and after the transmission 109 event (Figure 2A ). In our model viruses are categorised as haplotypes, that is, according to the variants 110 they contain at a subset of positions in their genome. As such, the viral population is represented as 111 a vector of haplotype frequencies; the population before transmission is represented by the vector q B . 112 During transmission, a random sample of N T viruses are passed on to the second host to give the founder 113 population q F . Selection for transmissibility, whereby genetic variants cause some viruses to be more 114 transmissible than others, is described by the function S T . The potentially small size of the founder pop-115 ulation means that the population evolves within the host under the influence of genetic drift to create 116 the large post-transmission population q A ; this process is approximated in our model by a population 117 bottleneck of effective size N G . Selection acting for within-host growth may further alter the genetic 118 composition of the population; this effect is described by the function S G . Our method thus allows for a 119 discrimination to be made between selection for increased within-host replication and for increased viral 120 transmissibility. Observations of the population are collected before and after transmission via a noisy 121 sequencing process to give the datasets x A and x B . The extent of noise in the sampling and sequencing is 122 characterised by the parameter C; a value of C = 0 would indicate that samples contain no information, 123 while a large C corresponds to noiseless sampling, as in a binomial model. 124 125 To summarise our approach, we note that both the transmission and within-host growth events can 126 be represented as sampling processes, which may each be biased by the effect of selection. As such, given 127 an estimate of the noise inherent to the sequencing process, and externally-derived estimates for N G and 128 S G , we can calculate an approximate likelihood for the parameters N T and S T given the observations 129 x B and x A . Maximising this likelihood gives an estimate for the size of the transmission bottleneck 130 and the extent to which specific genetic variants within the pre-transmission population confer increased 131 transmissibility upon viruses. 132 133 In our model we discriminate between changes in a population arising from selection and those aris-134 ing due to the population bottleneck. This is achieved by considering regions of the genome between 135 which recombination or reassortment has removed linkage disequilibrium between alleles ( Figure 2B ). As 136 transmission involves whole viruses, the bottleneck N T is preserved between regions. Meanwhile, in the 137 absence of epistasis, selection acting upon one region of the virus does not influence the composition of the 138 population in other parts of the genome. As such, a cross-region calculation estimates both N T and the 139 . doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 involving the absolute number of reads of a genome position, which specifies the depth of noise-free reads 158 that would produce the same degree of certainty in an allele frequency. This statistic is dominated by the 159 smaller of C and the absolute read depth; for large C this statistic is close to the absolute read depth, 160 while as the number of reads describing a variant frequency becomes large, the effective depth tends to 161 C + 1.

" Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 which have caused more 24 than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its 25 case fatality rate (CFR). 26 The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of 27 dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where 28 T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a 29 T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase 30 (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T 31 value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values 32 (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. 33",Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China 1

Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a group of non-enveloped, 49 single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses in the family Astroviridae. 50 HAstVs are causative agents of viral diarrhea in young children, 51 immunocompromised patients, and elderly individuals (1-5). The astrovirus 52 genome has three open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode two 53 nonstructural polyproteins (nsPs), and ORF2 encodes the capsid protein (6). The 54 nsP1a polyprotein, transcribed from ORF1a, is involved in viral transcription 55 and replication. When HAstV infects a host cell, nsP1a is cleaved into at least 56 four products, named nsP1a/1, nsP1a/2, nsP1a/3 (protease), and nsP1a/4. The 57 nsP1a/4 protein is located at the C-terminal end of nsP1a.Several domains have 58 been identified in nsP1a/4, including two coiled-coil regions, a death domain 59 (DD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a putative viral genome-linked 60 protein(VPg), and a hypervariable region (HVR)(7-12). It was confirmed that 61 nsP1a/4 plays important roles in the activation of capsid maturation and the 62 regulation of RNA replication (13, 14).

" The mechanisms underlying multicellular development in the animal stem lineage may 25 be reconstructed through the study of choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of 26 animals. To determine the genetic underpinnings of multicellularity in the emerging 27 model choanoflagellate S. rosetta, we performed a screen for mutants with defects in 28 multicellular rosette development. In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single 29 cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into 30 amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding 31 glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the 32 extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to 33 donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and 34 cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that 35 glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation 36 in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating 37 development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.",Glycosyltransferases promote development and prevent promiscuous cell
" Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children.

" OBJECTIVES To compare chest CT findings in heart failure with those of Corona Virus Disease 2019 pneumonia. BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.",How to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from heart failure with computed tomography at initial medical contact during epidemic period Running title: CT imaging for COVID-19 and heart failure

" Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples. Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 Kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 38,41 In addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: S1 and S2. 10,48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2,21,38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Massachusetts. 16 This genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to diagnose IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus. One of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for IBV uses S1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of IBV and identified six genotypes (I-VI), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of IBV. 44 Among the six genotypes, genotype I (G-I) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 As such, sequencing of the S1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of IBV within samples. The genetic classification of IBV has relied on genotype-specific RT-qPCR assays, serotype-specific S1 RT-qPCR 32,40 and/or pan-IBV S1 RT-PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 Genotype-specific RT-qPCRs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the S1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. Additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. Lastly, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have SPF embryos readily available. Lastly, cloning of PCR products has been used to detect multiple IBV sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) All rights reserved.

As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks. Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics. Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. A universal S1 primer set, 27 tailed with the MinION universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, Table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the IBV S1 gene for IBV. The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0. The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds.

Centrifuge 24 , Kraken 50 , QIIME 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of Nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing. Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV All rights reserved.

" PARP2 belongs to a family of proteins involved in cell differentiation, DNA 15 damage repair, cellular energy expenditure, chromatin modeling and cell differentiation. 16 In addition to these overlapping functions with PARP1, PARP2 participates in 17 spermatogenesis, T-cell maturation, extraembryonic endoderm formation and 18 adipogenesis. The function(s) of PARP2 is far from complete, and the mechanism(s) by 19 which the gene and protein are regulated are unknown. In this study, we found that two 20 different mechanisms are used in vitro to regulate PARP2 levels. In the presence of serum, 21 PARP2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, however, when serum is 22 removed, PARP2 is rapidly sequestered into an SDS-and urea-insoluble fraction. This 23 sequestration is relieved by serum in a dose-dependent manner, and again PARP2 is 24 detected by immunoblotting. Furthermore, and despite the presence of a putative serum 25 response element in the PARP2 gene, transcription is not affected by serum deprivation. 26 These observations that PARP2 is tightly regulated by distinct pathways highlights the 27 critical roles PARP2 plays under different physiological conditions. 28 29",Serum-dependent and independent regulation of PARP2
" The advent of the genomic era has made elucidating gene function at large scale a pressing challenge. ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway™ donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway™-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment.

Human ORFeomes have also been generated and made publicly available, with the latest version containing sequence-confirmed ORFs for more than 11,000 human genes (29). Most ORFeome libraries are created using the highly versatile Gateway™ cloning approach (30).

Previously, we have reported the development of a first generation C. albicans ORFeome, in which 644 full-length ORFs, encoding signaling proteins (transcription factors and kinases), as well as cell wall proteins and proteins involved in DNA processes (repair, replication and recombination), were cloned in the Gateway™ vector pDONR207 (31). Here we describe the generation and validation of the latest Candida albicans ORFeome collection, which consists of 5,102 ORFs in pDONR207, allowing the transfer of the cloned genes into a variety of C. albicans Gateway™-compatible expression vectors. To this end, we also provide a panel of 15 expression vectors that differ in the combination of promoter/selection marker they are carrying, and give different options regarding the tagging of the cloned gene product. These 15 expression vectors have been validated using the filament-specific transcription factor UME6.

" Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu.

" Domain growth plays an important role in many biological systems, and so the inclusion of domain growth in models of these biological systems is important to understanding how these biological systems function. In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do. These results will be of interest to researchers in developmental biology, as they suggest that the nature of domain growth can determine the characteristics of cell populations. * ross@maths.ox.ac.uk In this work we examine how domain growth affects the evolution of spatial correlations between agents in IBMs, and importantly, how the way in which domain growth is implemented affects spatial correlations differently.

" Background: Since the 2019-nCoV outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% -22.38% of the peak number of infections.

" Formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic condensates of stalled translation initiation complexes, is regulated by post-translational protein modification. Alphaviruses interfere with SG formation in response to inhibition of host protein synthesis through the activities of nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3). nsP3 has a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that binds and can remove ADP-ribose from ADPribosylated proteins and a C-terminal hypervariable domain that binds essential SG component G3BP1. We showed that the hydrolase activity of chikungunya virus nsP3 macrodomain removed ADPribosylation of G3BP1 and suppressed SG formation. ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsP3 mutants allowed stress-induced cytoplasmic condensation of translation initiation factors. nsP3 also disassembled SG-like aggregates enriched with translation initiation factors that are induced by the expression of FUS mutant R495X linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, our data indicate that regulation of ADP-ribosylation controls the localization of translation initiation factors during virus infection and other pathological conditions.

Non-membranous structures are prevalent in cells and critical for cellular functions, including RNA metabolism, embryonic cell fate specification, and neuronal activities [1] [2] [3] . Although the components of these non-membranous structures are often dynamically exchanged with the surrounding milieu, the compositions of these cellular structures remain distinct [4] . It is, however, unclear how individual components are selectively retained in these non-membranous structures. Stress granules (SGs), one of the best characterized dynamic non-membranous structures, are RNAprotein assemblies formed in response to a variety of environmental cues [3] . In most cases, these environmental cues activate stress-responsive protein kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), resulting in the stalling of translation initiation [3] . The sudden influx of untranslated mRNAs is proposed to seed the formation of SGs, where the polynucleotide promotes local concentration of proteins through non-covalent binding [5] . These RNA-binding proteins are highly enriched with low-complexity regions, and emergent data indicate that the nonspecific, weak interactions between these regions are responsible for the condensation of proteins to form higherorder structures, such as microscopically visible SGs [6] [7] [8] . Depending on the type of stress, the composition of SGs could vary [9], but certain common components, such as Ras GTP-activating protein-binding proteins G3BP1/2, are essential for SG formation [10, 11] . Dysregulation of SG assembly/disassembly and mutations in the low-complexity region of specific SG proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as viral infection, cancer and neurodegeneration [1, [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of SG assembly is critical for designing novel therapeutics. SG assembly is regulated positively and negatively by post-translational modifications of proteins, including those that conjugate simple chemical groups (such as phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc glycosylation, methylation, acetylation), attach polypeptides (e.g., neddylation), and add nucleotides as in the case of ADP-ribosylation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . ADP-ribosylation refers to the addition of one or more ADP-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. ribose units onto proteins [22] [23] [24] . In humans, ADP-ribosylation is accomplished primarily by a family of 17 ADP-ribosyltransferases, a subset of which is commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) [22] [23] [24] . Polymers of ADP-ribose [i.e., poly(ADP-ribose or PAR], five PARPs and two isoforms of the degradative enzyme PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) have been identified in SGs, where selective SG proteins are 25, 26] . Overexpression of these PARPs and PARG isoforms induces and suppresses SG formation, respectively, while PARG knockdown delays SG disassembly [19, 25] . PAR, like RNA, has been proposed to seed formation of non-membranous structures by facilitating the high concentration of low complexity region-containing proteins locally through noncovalent binding to the repetitive monomeric units of the polymer [19, [25] [26] [27] [28] . The non-covalent PAR-protein interaction also facilitates the targeting of specific proteins to SGs [25, 26, 29] , such as TDP-43-a key protein involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Such a targeting mechanism based on PAR-binding to protein is proposed to regulate TDP-43 localization and prevent the formation of pathological aggregates in ALS patients [25, 26] . Certain PARP inhibitors prevent the neurotoxicity in neuronal cells [26, 30] , suggesting that pharmacological modulation of PAR-mediated protein targeting could have potential therapeutic benefit. SG assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated during infection by many viruses, often reflecting cellular translation status [31][32][33][34]. In the early phase of infection, the presence of doublestranded viral RNAs activates protein kinase R (PKR), resulting in eIF2α phosphorylation, mRNA translation stalling and assembly of SGs enriched with translation factors [32,34]. Yet, many viruses disassemble SGs or suppress SG formation [32,34], but the mechanisms and the physiological roles remain largely unclear. For example, the mosquito-borne alphaviruses, which cause a range of diseases from rashes and arthritis to encephalitis, induce SG formation transiently in the early stage of infection, followed by disassembly [32,[34] [35] [36] . Previous studies have identified the alphaviral nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), a key factor for virus replication and virulence [37] [38] [39] , as able to suppress SG assembly [36, [40] [41] [42] . nsP3 is a tripartite protein composed of a highly conserved All rights reserved.

" Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and 24,782 weaned pups were used across 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (79%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam's strain explained more than the sire's strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam's strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background and that litter size is largely determined by dam.strain rather than sire.strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.

" One striking characteristic of certain herpesviruses is their ability to induce rapid and 10 widespread RNA decay in order to gain access to host resources. This phenotype is induced by 11 viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in KSHV, muSOX in MHV68, BGLF5 in EBV and vhs in 12 HSV-1. Here, we performed comparative RNA-seq upon expression of these herpesviral 13 endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with 14 previous reports, we found that approximately two thirds of transcripts are downregulated in 15 cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among transcripts spared from degradation, 16 we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escape degradation from all tested 17 endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that like the 18 previously identified escapees, this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3'UTR. We 19 then show that C19ORF66, a known anti-viral protein, is a potent KSHV restriction factor, 20 suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host 21 response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint 22 key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator. 23 24 25 26 All rights reserved.

" Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms and rapid pandemic in China. With the hope to identify candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational approach to screen for available commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for the M pro of 2019-nCoV. Up to 10 commercial medicines that may form hydrogen bounds to key residues within the binding pocket of 2019-nCoV M pro were identified, which may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir and may also function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar M pro binding sites and pocket structures.

" The respiratory tract surface is protected from inhaled pathogens by a secreted layer of mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins. Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5ACdeficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity. author/funder.

" Based on results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia. of exported infection cases have been identified in Japan, Korea, the United States, Canada, France, etc. On January 30, 2020, the WHO has confirmed 7,818 cases worldwide, and 7,736 cases were reported in China. According to clinical observation, the most common symptoms were fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. Less common symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Based on three recent publications 1-3 , we compared the incidence of these common symptoms and found that the incidence of diarrhea significantly differed in these three reports. As some patients suffering from diarrhea will first seek help from the gastroenterologist, incorrect estimation of diarrhea may increase the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in the gastroenterology department. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the clinical features of pneumonia patients will further improve hospital infection control and reduce healthcare-associated infection. By using the next-generation sequencing technology, scientists revealed that the sequence and genome structure of 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV 4,5 .

" Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.

" To differentiate different entities of appendicitis through studying cluster/outbreak, ascertain common setting of cluster/outbreak, and provide the epidemiological evidences of infectious etiology of appendicitis. Background: Differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis and the infectious etiology of appendicitis are current hot topics. Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from nonperforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis. In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic nonperforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes.

" There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Main text. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of COVID-19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 Feb 2020 (1). With sustained transmission reported in China, Japan, Iran, Italy, and South Korea (1), the outbreak is on the verge of becoming a pandemic. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. One possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 will follow its closest genetic relative, SARS-CoV, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). Increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (3). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4). Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (5). This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them. The transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (6). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). Current COVID-19 case fatality rates in China are estimated at 2.9% within Hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower severity than SARS and MERS but higher severity than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In terms of transmission, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (11) (12) (13) . Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (14), while SARS infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (15). The .

" Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the ""coronavirus"" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency.

Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours.

" Commercial multiplex assays, built on different chemistries and platforms are widely 25 available for simultaneous detection of pathogens that cause respiratory infections. However, 26 these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In 27 this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory 28 pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and 29 probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following 30 optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-31 probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were 32 mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2X8-wells of a 96-well plate. PPMs from strip-tubes were then added to the wells using a multichannel pipette for real-time 34 PCR. Individual PCR assays were optimized using previously known specimens (n=397) with 35 91%-100% concordance with culture, DFA or PCR results. Respanel was then tested in a routine 36 manner at two different sites using specimens (n=147) previously tested by Qiagen Resplex I&II 37 or Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 assays. The sensitivity, specificity and 38 accuracy of Respanel were 94%, 95% and 95%, respectively, against Resplex and 88%, 100% 39 and 99%, respectively, against FTDRP21. Respanel detected 48% more pathogens (p<0.05) than 40 Resplex but the rate of pathogen detection was not significantly different from FTDRP21.

" Background: New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach. Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.",Original Article
" Honey bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive. One of the characteristics of RNA interference (RNAi) is systemic spread of the silencing signal among cells and tissues throughout the organism. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bee's hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA as well as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic signaling between honey bees and potentially among other closely interacting organisms.",A transmissible RNA pathway in honey bees
" The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A six-year follow-up study.",Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on SARS- CoV immunological studies
" Fasting paradigms elicit a wide-range of health benefits including suppressing inflammation. Exploring the molecular mechanisms that prevent inflammation during caloric restriction may yield promising new therapeutic targets. During fasting, activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) promotes the utilization of lipids as an energy source. Herein, we show that ligand activation of PPARA directly upregulates the long non-coding RNA gene Gm15441 through binding sites within its promoter. Gm15441 expression suppresses its antisense transcript, encoding thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). This, in turn, decreases TXNIP-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 (CASP1) cleavage, and proinflammatory interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) maturation. Gm15441-null mice were developed and shown to be more susceptible to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to exhibit elevated CASP1 and IL1B cleavage in response to metabolic and inflammatory stimuli. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which PPARA attenuates hepatic inflammasome activation in response to metabolic stress through lncRNA Gm15441 induction. Txnip expression in vivo. Gm15441 LSL mice were treated with a PPARA agonist or fasted to assess how loss of Gm15441 impacts hepatic inflammasome activation in response to both pharmacological and physiologically-induced metabolic stress. TXNIP protein, caspase-1 (CASP1) levels, and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) cleavage were elevated in Gm15441 LSL mice and were further increased by PPARA activation, indicating that this lncRNA plays a major role in attenuating inflammasome activation. Thus, hepatic PPARA directly regulates the lncRNA Gm15441, which in turn suppresses Txnip expression, which attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation during periods of metabolic stress. These studies revealed a novel regulatory mechanism supporting the beneficial effects of fasting, namely, reduced inflammation. Results To assess the regulation of lncRNAs by PPARA, RNA-seq was performed using total liver RNA isolated from Ppara +/+ mice, both with and without dietary exposure to the PPARA agonist WY-14643. A lncRNA discovery pipeline was implemented that identified 15,558 liver-expressed lncRNA genes. Of these, 13,343 were intergenic, 1,966 were antisense, and 249 were intragenic lncRNAs. 44% of the 15,558 liver-expressed lncRNAs are considered novel (Melia and Waxman, 2019). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that a total of 1,735 RefSeq genes and 442 liver-expressed lncRNA genes responded to treatment with WY-14643 at an expression foldchange >2 at FDR<0.05, with 968 RefSeq genes and 245 lncRNA genes upregulated, and 767",Long non-coding RNA Gm15441 attenuates hepatic inflammasome activation in response to metabolic stress
" Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian 23 species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several 24 innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate 25 efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' 26 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for 27 high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses 28 that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, 29 we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune 30 response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular 31 pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus 32 replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially 33 restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication 34 did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, 35 ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-36 ) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased 37 relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to 38 establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for 39 resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA 40 sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity. 41 42 43 All rights reserved.

" Pathogens are embedded in a complex network of microparasites that can collectively or individually alter disease dynamics and outcomes. Chronic pathogens, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating morbidity and mortality. Pathogen interactions are ubiquitous in nature, but poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. We report here on ten years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioral data to utilize pathogen networks to test if chronic infections shape infection by acute pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterize associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found significant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identified potential facilitative and competitive interactions between acute and chronic pathogens.

" During the decoding of a subset of mRNAs a proportion of ribosomes 8 productively shift to the -1 reading frame at a specific, slippage-prone site 1 . While the 9 great majority of occurrences of the ""Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting"" (-1 10 PRF) involve viruses 2 , other mobile elements or retroelements 1 , a dramatic instance of 11 utilized human cellular -1 frameshifting in a non-retroelement derived mRNA has been 12 reported.

Efficient -1 frameshifting requires a slippery site together with an appropriately 23 positioned stimulatory RNA structure. The reported CCR5 slip site (U_UUA_AAA where 24 underscores set of the reading frame) has previously been shown to facilitate high 25 levels of -1 frameshifting in vitro when positioned 5' of a known stimulatory pseudoknot 6 . 26 However, frameshifting efficiencies in vivo could be substantially different and further, at 27 least as of 2016, there were no known virus frameshift sites with the reported CCR5 28 shift site 1 . 29 30 We challenge the reported results by showing that frameshifting at the relevant 31 CCR5 sequence cassette does not occur above background levels and that the claimed 32 pertinent sequence is not as distinctively conserved as previously presented. Lastly, we 33 demonstrate that previously published retroelement derived human frameshift signals 34 do indeed harbor frameshift activity. 35 36 Using BLAST, we first identified orthologues of human CCR5 in the NCBI RefSeq 37 database. Sequences were aligned and, on examining the frameshift region, we 38 observed substitutions in the slippery site sequence which would likely decrease or 39 eliminate frameshifting in related organisms. Indeed, none of the nucleotides in the 40 slippery site are conserved across vertebrates (Figure 1). The predicted frameshift site 41 in CCR5 was previously reported as most highly conserved in primates, except for 42 Lemur catta 3 . Primate CCR5 CDS sequences were aligned and nucleotide conservation 43 was measured at single nucleotide resolution (Figure 2A) and smoothed in a 10 44 .

This analysis showed that the entire CDS, not 45 just the predicted frameshift site, is highly conserved among primates. Thus, the 46 observation that the frameshift site is mostly conserved in primates does not indicate 47 that the (putative) ability to frameshift is subject to purifying selection. 48 49 Dual-luciferase vectors in which the test cassette is sandwiched between and 50 fused to both Firefly and Renilla luciferase encoding sequences, have been widely used 51 for assaying translational recoding events (Figure 3A). The frameshifting efficiency is 52 calculated by dividing Firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity. This ratio is 53 then normalized to an in-frame control vector in which Renilla and Firefly luciferases are 54 both situated in the zero-frame to account for differences in activity between the two 55 enzymes (a ratio of a ratio) (Figure 3B). 56 57 In nearly all cases the fused test encoded polypeptide has only a small or no 58 effect on the upstream encoded luciferase activity. However, in one case luciferase 59 activity was anomalously low (unpublished) and we developed a variant vector system 60 (pSGDluc 7 ) containing a StopGo sequence directly 3' of the first and immediately 5' of 61 the second luciferase encoding sequence. Subsequently we made another variant by 62 removing a potential splice site, pSGDlucV3.0 (deposited with Addgene). Thus in earlier 63 constructs, where the insert-encoded peptides were appended to the C-terminus of 64 Renilla luciferase, the Renilla luciferase activity could dropparticularly for the short 65 zero-frame encoded peptide, causing an artificial inflation of translation recoding rates. 66 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/513333 doi: bioRxiv preprint This problem has been overcome by inserting flanking StopGo sequences that result in 67 co-translational excision of the insert-encoded peptides, thus releasing independent 68 Renilla and Firefly proteins that are identical in sequence for both the test and in-frame 69 control constructs. The publication on CCR5 frameshifting utilized the very first iteration 70 of a dual luciferase vector that we developed in 1998 8 . 71 72 We recloned the same CCR5 frameshift sequence tested in the original article 73 into pSGDlucV3.0. For CCR5 we used negative controls comparable to those in the 74 original article, which include a slip site mutant (UUUAAAA  GCGCGCG for Y.A.K., 75 UUUAAAA  AUUCAAA for G.L.), a 5`-termination control (also known as a premature 76 termination codon control or PTC control) and a 3`-termination control (also known as 77 an out-of-frame stop codon control or OOF control). Lastly, we included measurements 78 from the empty vector alone (Figure 3C). All four of these controls are meant to 79 establish a baseline for background levels of luminescence 80 81 The dual luciferase assays were carried out in the same cell line used in the 82 original article, HeLa. Renilla luciferase, the reference luciferase, is stable for all the 83 constructs (Figure 4A). Similarly Firefly luciferase activities for the in-frame controls of 84 CCR5 and a HIV-1 control are consistent as well, indicating that when forced to express 85 Firefly luciferase, both constructs produce proteins with similar activity. The Firefly 86 luciferase activity for the WT HIV-1 frameshift construct is >40 fold higher than that of 87 WT CCR5 or any of its negative controls. Furthermore, the Firefly luciferase activity for 88 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/513333 doi: bioRxiv preprint CCR5 and all its negative controls are all comparable to the activity of the empty vector 89 control, which is the baseline for background levels of Firefly luciferase activity ( Figure   90 4B). After normalizing the luciferase activities for the test vectors to their respective in-91 frame control vectors, we find that HIV-1 shows frameshift rates that are comparable to 92 previously reported findings in HeLa cells 9 . However, CCR5 WT frameshifting is 93 ~0.15%, indistinguishable from its negative controls, indicating that CCR5 does not 94 frameshift above background at our limit of sensitivity and is certainly far less than the 95 previously reported level of 9-11% 3 . In fact, CCR5 SSM demonstrates slightly higher 96 rates of FS than the WT, indicating that translational recoding values this low are 97 indicative of background ( Figure 4C) . These experiments were repeated in HEK293T 98 cells to control for cell-line specific results and we found that the results followed 99 identical trends to those obtained in HeLa cells (Figure 4D-F) . To ensure that these results were repeatable, the cloning and assaying of CCR5 102 frameshifting was completed independently by a different laboratory (G.L., J.F.A.), 103 which used modestly different cloning and assaying strategies. When utilizing both 104 HeLa and HEK293T cells, we found that CCR5 frameshifted at an insignificant rate as 105 well (Figure 5A-F). 106 107 Retrotransposons and retroviruses share a common origin. Ribosomal 108 frameshifting has been well documented in viruses and thus it stands to reason that 109 retrotransposons and/or derivatives of retrotransposons in the human genome could 110 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/513333 doi: bioRxiv preprint frameshift. Three derivatives of retrotransposons in the human genome, PNMA3 (Ma3), 111 PNMA5 (Ma5), and PEG10, have been previously demonstrated to frameshift in-vivo 112 and in-vitro 1 . All three encode zero-frame proteins with homology to the viral protein gag 113 and their trans-frame protein have similarity to gag-pol. All three share a slippery site 114 common with some viruses in the Retroviridae family, GGGAAAC. These sequences 115 were assayed in both HeLa and HEK293T cells (Figure 6). Although the rates of -1 116 PRF were slightly different from previously reported, all three signals stimulated 117 frameshifting far above background. These results further confirm the fidelity of the 118 pSGDlucV3.0 vector for assaying -1 PRF, already seen for other translational recoding 119 events 7 . 120 121 In conclusion, using an improved reporter assay system, we find no evidence of -122 1 frameshifting above background levels on the CCR5 mRNA. Additionally, a lack of 123 statistically significant purifying selection acting on the slip site (a hallmark for 124 functionally relevant frameshift signals) supports the argument that CCR5 does not 125 contain a biologically important frameshift signal. There are several possible 126 explanations for the discrepancy between the reported CCR5 results and the results 127 presented here but the most obvious one is the standard decoding of a significant 128 percentage of mRNAs generated by cryptic splicing. Methods 133 Alignment of CCR5 slippery sites 134 The NCBI mRNA and RefSeq BLAST databases were searched with blastn using the 135 human CCR5 mRNA (accession NM_000579.3) as query on December 4th, 2018 using 136 default parameters, with the number of hits expanded from 100 to 500. The best 137 sequence per organism, as determined by 'Max Score', was taken up until 70% query 138 cover. These sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. This alignment was trimmed to 139 only include the putative frameshift region of CCR5 that was generated by code written 140 in Python 3. The alignment image was generated using the box-shade server 141 (https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html). 142 143 CCR5 Primate CDS analysis 144 Of the sequences obtained in the ortholog search, only those belonging to the 145 taxonomic descriptor of 'primate' (taxid 9443) were used. Lemur catta sequences were 146 ignored, since the original manuscript states that the CCR5 frameshift signal is not 147 conserved in Lemur catta. All CDS sequences were aligned with MUSCLE and then 148 either at single nucleotide resolution or a smoothed 10 nucleotide window plotted in 149 Python 3. doi: bioRxiv preprint pSGDlucV3.0 was generated by introducing silent mutations into the Renilla coding 153 sequence to disrupt two potential donor splice sites (TGGgtaagt). 154 For Figures 4 and 6 (Y.A.K.) the vector was digested with PspXI and Bgl-II. Overlapping 155 oligonucleotides for insert sequences were ordered from Sigma Aldrich 156 (Supplementary Table 1), resuspended at 100 M, diluted to 10 M, and then mixed 157 together at a 1:100 dilution.

" The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.

" Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I 2 -statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively.

" Scintillators exhibit visible luminescence, called scintillation, when irradiated with X-rays. Given that X-rays penetrate through biological tissues, X-ray-induced scintillation would enable remote optogenetic control of neural functions at any depths in the brain. Here we show that a yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator, Ce-doped Gd3(Al,Ga)5O12 (Ce:GAGG), can effectively activate red-shifted excitatory and inhibitory opsins. Using these scintillator-opsin combinations, we successfully activated and inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons of freely moving mice by X-ray irradiation, producing bi-directional modulation of place preference behavior. The Ce:GAGG crystal was biocompatible and could be implanted for a long period without progressive neuroinflammatory responses. Neither brain injury nor behavioral dysfunction was acutely induced by radiation during the behavioral tests. Thus, X-ray-induced scintillation allows wireless control of cellular functions in living animals, expanding X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine.",Remote control of neural function by X-ray-induced scintillation
" Understanding the causes of the cost is considered the Holy Grail in the antibiotic resistance field, as it is the main determinant of the prevalence of resistances upon reducing antibiotics use. We show that DNA breaks can explain most of the variation in the cost of resistances common in pathogens. Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug. In summary, we revealed key mechanisms underlying the cost of antibiotic resistance that can be exploited to specifically eliminate resistant bacteria. Antibiotic resistance entails a large health and economic burden worldwide (1). Its maintenance and spread in bacterial populations depend on the rate at which resistance is acquired and on its effect on bacterial fitness. This effect is typically deleterious, resulting in the so-called cost of resistance. The cost of resistance is influenced by the environment, by interactions between the resistances and the genetic background in which they appear (epistasis), and by subsequent acquisition of mutations compensating for fitness defects (compensatory evolution) (2). Importantly, the magnitude of the cost is the main biological parameter influencing the fate of resistances upon reducing antibiotic use (3). Despite its importance, the causes of the cost are far from being completely understood (4), and the identification of these causes has become the ""Holy Grail"" in the antibiotic resistance field. Resistance mutations often map to genes encoding proteins targeted by antibiotics. These target proteins are typically involved in essential functions, such as transcription, translation, DNA replication or cell wall biosynthesis. Resistance mutations cause alterations in the structure of the target protein, rendering it insensitive to the drug, but often adversely affecting its function (2,3,5). These pleiotropic effects hold the key to manipulating resistance levels in bacterial populations (3). Rifampicin and streptomycin resistance mutations (Rif R and Str R ), common in pathogenic bacteria (6-8), map to the genes rpoB and rpsL, encoding the β' subunit of the RNA polymerase and the protein S12 of the 30S ribosomal subunit, respectively. Rif R and Str R mutations are representative examples of resistances to antibiotics targeting transcription and translation, respectively. Rif R mutations show different costs (9,10) and cause alterations in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, slippage or termination (9,11-23). Likewise, most Str R mutations also cause a cost (24-26) and affect translation fidelity and processivity (24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Thus, at present, the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are thought to be caused by defects in protein synthesis, either at a global cellular level (35-37) or limited to specific functions or regulons (22, 24, 38, 39) . We recently showed that the fitness cost of double resistance (Rif R Str R ) can be reduced via overexpression of nusG or nusE (40), which encode the proteins that physically connect the RNA polymerase and the ribosome (41). This suggests that the reduction of the cost can be achieved by reinforcing the coupling between transcription and translation, besides the previously described partial recovery in protein biosynthesis (3). Coupling between transcription and translation is known to prevent spontaneous backtracking of the RNA polymerase which, if exacerbated, can cause a series of molecular events that ultimately lead to the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (42)(43) (44) (45) (46) . This led us to hypothesize that cells carrying different Rif R and Str R mutations have higher number of DNA breaks, which greatly contribute to their cost. In this study, we show that DNA breaks caused by resistance mutations are major contributors to their fitness cost, explaining 73% of its variation across resistant genotypes. The involvement of Rloops in the generation of DNA breaks allowed us to identify RNase HI as an important determinant of the cost of resistance, which we validate using a repurposed drug. We further show that targeting RNase HI is a plausible strategy for the selective elimination of resistant bacteria, as lack of RNase HI leads to extinction of resistant clones when competing against sensitive bacteria in laboratory conditions, abolishing compensatory evolution. Importantly, eradication of resistant bacteria lacking RNase HI is remarkably efficient in the mammalian gut as well. Altogether, we reveal an unexpected cause of the cost of antibiotic resistance, which can be exploited to selectively eliminate resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint In order to test if Rif R and Str R mutations generate DNA breaks, and whether DNA breaks contribute to the cost of resistance, we simultaneously measured competitive fitness and activation of the SOS response, a well-known proxy specific for the occurrence of DNA breaks (47,48). We carried out these assays in sensitive Escherichia coli, Str R strains (RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , and RpsL K43R ), Rif R strains (RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ), and double resistant mutants carrying the nine possible combinations of these resistance alleles. Remarkably, fourteen out of the fifteen resistant strains show increased SOS activation ( Figure 1A ), demonstrating that resistance mutations indeed cause DNA breaks. Moreover, the SOS induction strongly correlates with the cost of resistance, explaining 73% of its variation ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance. To independently confirm the occurrence of DNA breaks in resistant bacteria, we used a system which permits direct visualization of double-stranded DNA ends by fluorescence microscopy (49). We combined this system with the SOS reporter, and analyzed a subset of resistant mutants and sensitive bacteria. As expected, this corroborated that resistance mutations indeed cause increased number of DNA breaks (Table 1, Figure S1 ). We then asked if resistance mutations involving a different mechanism which could lead to perturbations of transcription-translation coupling also generate DNA breaks. The commonly used antibiotic erythromycin targets the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting translation and its coupling with transcription (50). Erythromycin resistance mutations (Erm R ) mapping to the genes rplD and rplV (encoding the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins L4 and L22, respectively) are known to reduce translation elongation rate (51,52), likely affecting transcription-translation coupling. We isolated Erm R clones carrying either RplD G66R or RplV Δ(82-84) mutations and found that both mutants show fitness cost and increased SOS ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating that other resistance mutations, with a 99 double orbital shaking (set as ""fast"") in a Biotek SYNERGY H1 benchtop microplate reader, measuring OD600 every 30 minutes during 24h. Adult C57BL/6J female mice (six to eight weeks old) were kept in ventilated cages under specified pathogen free (SPF) barrier conditions at the animal facility of the IGC. To overcome bacterial colonization resistance, mice were treated with streptomycin (5 g/L) in drinking water during seven days and then put on regular autoclaved water for two days to wash out the antibiotic from the intestine. The following day, animals were deprived of food and water during the 4 hours prior to inoculation by oral gavage of 100 µl of bacterial suspension containing ~10 9 cells. All animals were then individually-caged, with food and water being available ad libitum. Each animal (6 per group) was gavaged with a mix (9:1) of CFP-tagged sensitive (either WT or ΔrnhA) and YFP-labeled double resistant bacteria (either RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y or ΔrnhA RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ). In order to obtain the bacterial suspensions, the strains were streaked individually onto appropriate antibiotic-supplemented LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, three independent colonies from each strain were inoculated separately in assay tubes containing 5ml of BHI broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m). The next day, each bacterial culture was diluted 100-fold (20 µl of overnight culture in 2 ml of fresh BHI broth, in 125 ml flasks) and incubated at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m) until reaching an OD600 ≈ 2. Then the cultures were washed once with 1X PBS and Flow cytometry was used to assess the appropriate cells numbers and prepare bacterial mixes for gavage. Mouse fecal pellets were collected at 8 hours after gavage, and afterwards on a daily basis during 13 days, to analyze the loads and frequency of each strain colonizing the gut along time. Fecal samples were stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C.

" Background In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n=44), severe or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; p<0.01).

" Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species.

" Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease 34 caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high 35 mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we 36 developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together 37 with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-38 like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to 39 enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of 40 IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid 41 without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against 42 surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, 43 as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in 44 protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein 45 immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens 46 induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in 47 relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, 48 both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to 49 induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, 50 optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and 51 incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine 52 development. 53 54 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infection 58 endemic to East Asia including China, Korea, and Japan. Gradual rise of disease incidence 59 and relatively high mortality have become a serious public health problem in the endemic 60 countries. In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA encoding four antigens, 61 Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, of SFTS virus (SFTSV) as a vaccine candidate. In order to enhance cell-62 mediated immunity, the viral antigens were fused with Flt3L and IL-2 gene was incorporated 63 into the plasmid. Immunization with the DNA vaccine provides complete protection against 64 lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses might play a 65 major role in the protection since we observed enhanced T cell responses specific to the viral 66 antigens but failed to detect neutralizing antibody in the immunized mice. When we 67 immunized with either viral glycoprotein, Gn protein induced relatively higher neutralizing 68 activity and better protection against SFTSV infection than Gc antigen, but neither generated 69 complete protection. Therefore, an optimal combination of DNA and protein elements, as 70 well as proper selection of target antigens, might be required to produce an effective SFTSV 71 vaccine. 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 .

" The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.",Highly ACE2 Expression in Pancreas May Cause Pancreas Damage After SARS-CoV-2 Infection

" A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31 st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal : bioRxiv preprint -2 -facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to ensure the functioning of and to avoid the breakdown of health system.","Breaking down of healthcare system: Mathematical modelling for controlling the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China"
" The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also 31 protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing 32 of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. 33 By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34 , we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are 35 required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis 36 virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that 39 activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. 42 Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and 43 endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, 44 cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives 45 low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts 46 RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. 48 . Importance 49 Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING 50 DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate 51 without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS's DNA binding and signaling 53 activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host 55 DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression 56 correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of 58 endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation. doi: bioRxiv preprint 61 A key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated 62 molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1). For 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct PRRs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to set up an antiviral state. During RNA 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded RNAs are detected in the cytosol by 66 the PRRs retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and related RIG-I-like receptors 67 (RLRs). However, the recent discovery of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict RNA viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during RNA virus 70 infection. 71 The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates ISG expression when 73 overexpressed (2). Although STING is involved in DNA sensing, STING -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (MEFs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (VSV), a negative-stand RNA virus (2, 3). Additionally, studies in MEFs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cDNAs (4), have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of RNA viruses and retroviruses, 79 presumably due to the accumulation of DNA in the cytosol (5, 6). It appears that this 80 DNA-based restriction is broad, as many RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cGAS-STING pathway, including flaviviruses (7-9), hepaciviruses (10, 82 STING does not directly interact with cytosolic DNA, but functions as an innate 84 immune adaptor protein to transduce signals between cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 85 (cGAS) and Tank-binding kinase 1, which subsequently phosphorylates the 86 transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to initiate an ISG response doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 158 growth of VSV-GFP, VSVΔM51A-GFP, and SINV-GFP, while THP-1 KO cells or 159 THP-1 KO cells reconstituted with inactive hcGAS-HA3x mutants showed little or no 160 restriction (Figure 3D-3F). As observed previously in MEFs, VSVΔM51A-GFP was 161 more potently restricted than VSV-GFP, but unlike in MEFs, infected fewer cells 162 expressing mutant cGAS. This was also true for SINV-GFP, albeit restriction with 163 WT hcGAS-HA3x was extremely potent, comparatively. It is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cGAS mutants was due to hcGAS-HA3x 165 overexpression in THP-1 cells, residual hcGAS activities, or normal clonal 166 variation of cells. Nevertheless, these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cGAS DNA binding and cGAMP synthase activities in RNA virus restriction. 168 Detection of cGAMP produced in response to DNA transfection but not 169 RNA virus infection. Because cGAMP synthesis activity was essential for RNA 170 virus restriction, we next sought to identify cGAMP produced in response to RNA . 676 2013.

" Identifying viruses and phages in a metagenomics sample has important implication in improving human health, preventing viral outbreaks, and developing personalized medicine. With the rapid increase in data files generated by next generation sequencing, existing tools for identifying and annotating viruses and phages in metagenomics samples suffer from expensive running time. In this paper, we developed a standalone pipeline, FastViromeExplorer, for rapid identification and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in big metagenomic data. Both real and simulated data validated FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large data, as well as in a time efficient manner.",FastViromeExplorer: A Pipeline for Virus and Phage Identification and Abundance Profiling in Metagenomics Data
" Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry. All rights reserved.

" Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host, integrate into the host's genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host. Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts' translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution. Here we presented an analysis of over 11,000 bacterial genomes from which we identified 36,488 prophages. Many phages appear to be limited by initiation of translation by the host's machinery, and may increase translation rates by carrying their own tRNA genes, effectively increasing the availability of both tRNAs loaded with methionine and of peptide deformylase. We have also demonstrated that phages maintain a highly conserved gene order that suggests phage genome mosaicism is limited to clusters of conserved genes rather than individual genes.",Prophage genomics reveals patterns in phage genome organization and replication
" Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the controlled slippage of the translating ribosome to an alternative frame. This tightly regulated process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS-CoV and is critical for their life cycle and virulence. It is also utilized throughout the tree of life to implement a feedback control mechanism to regulate polyamine levels. However, despite its universality and clinical relevance, a limited number of studies investigated this process on only a few selected examples, largely due to a lack of experimental means. Here, we developed a highthroughput, fluorescence-based approach to assay the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested >12.000 sequences based on 15 viral and human frameshifting events, allowing us to elucidate the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting in a systematic way and to discover novel regulatory features. We also utilized our approach to search for novel frameshifting events and identified dozens of previously unknown frameshifting sites in human, showing that programmed ribosomal frameshifting is more common than previously anticipated. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified subtypespecific differences as well as associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of gagpol frameshifting rates. We further devised a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts frameshifting rates of novel variants (up to r=0.70), including subtle differences between HIV isolates (r=0.44), providing a basis for the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed ribosomal frameshifting. author/funder.

" Viruses interact with hundreds to thousands of proteins in mammals, yet adaptation 6 against viruses has only been studied in a few proteins specialized in antiviral defense. Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or 8 affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 9 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved 10 across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained 11 proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, 12 virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in 13 humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across 14 all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results 15 demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change 16 across mammalian and human proteomes. 17",Title: Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals

It included clinical and demographic information about the viral diseases, associated signs and symptoms, transmission and protection, and attitudes about the MERS-CoV disease. The study was accomplished between August and November, 2017 and 477 participants of the medical city, successfully completed the study questionnaire (Appendix I ). Females represented a majority and there was an indirectly proportional decrease with the increasing age. Gradual educational increase levels reflected dominance of the university degree holders. Jobs were dominated by nurses and non-Saudis were a majority whilst, the highly experienced, (>10 years) were a minority. A majority recognized the viral transmission methods, popular information sources of MERS-CoV and associated medical terms. Highest scores were observed in dealing with protective aids and recognizing symptoms of disease. High adherence to hand hygiene protocols and correct washing steps were recorded. Correct and high levels were observed in taking preventive measures and avoiding infection. Participants responded correctly to negative and wrong actions that patients should refrain from. High scores were observed in taking appreciable attitudes towards oneself and towards others. Expatriates were majority and nurses were dominant which, necessitates Saudization of this sector. Ministry of health pamphlets and seminars were of less impact in invigilating HW, hence, more attention and efforts are demanded.

" Zika virus is spread mainly by the bite of an infected mosquito, which can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika in the near future, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the key role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. In response to the current global health emergency triggered by the Zika outbreak, we successfully obtained several active forms of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further attempted to discover its inhibitors from eatable plants and traditional herbal medicines to immediately fight Zika. Here, for the first time, we discovered that quercetin, a flavonoid extensively existing in many fruits and vegetables, effectively inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro. We further quantify its inhibitory activity with IC 50 of 26.0 ± 0.1 µM; and K i of 23.0 ± 1.3 µM. As quercetin has been extensively found in fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, our discovery would benefit the public to immediately fight Zika. All rights reserved.

" Abstract: 25 26 Macroscopic descriptions of populations commonly assume that encounters between 27 individuals are well mixed; i.e., each individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with 28 any other individual. Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty 29 of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a 30 mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time series data from Pakistan and 31 compared maximum-likelihood estimates of ""mixing parameters"" when disaggregating data 32 across an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not 33 only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to 34 differences in mixing. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead 35 to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines 36 or other control efforts. We complement this analysis with relevant contemporary environmental 37 drivers of dengue. 38 39",and transmission of dengue across Pakistan
" syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2% ， 68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection. : medRxiv preprint person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital and family settings 2,6,7 . As of February 17, 2020, more than 71,000 laboratory-confirmed and 1,770 death cases have been documented in China and in other countries worldwide (including the USA, German, japan and South Korea) 8,9 . The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was around 2%. The WHO has recently declared the SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern 10 . Thus, diagnostic tests specific for this infection are urgently needed for confirming suspected cases, screening patients and conducting virus surveillance. Identification of pathogens mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection. According to the traditional Koch's postulates, virus isolation is the gold standard for virus diagnosis in the laboratory. Thus, based on SARS-CoV-2 possesses a strong capability to infect humans, CDC recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from COVID-19 patients under investigation. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, the spectrum of the available diagnostic tools is tight. In the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in human clinical specimens by next-generation sequencing, cell culture, and electron microscopy 11 .

Then the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (29870-bp, excluding the poly (A) tail) in GenBank (accession number MN908947) was released quickly on January 10, 2020, which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) 12 . On the basis of analysis of this complete genomes obtained in this study, several laboratories developed molecular detection tools based on targeting ORF1ab, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene N, and E regions of viral spike genes [13][14][15] . And then the rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed to recent advances in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and microarray-based assays. At present, RT-PCR is a widely used detection technique for SARS-CoV-2 and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic 14 . Currently, the standard of reference for the COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis is a positive result in nucleic acid detection assay for the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and blood, respiratory tract specimens were including nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. And the patients confirmed with the COVID-19 pneumonia had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens can discharge from hospital. However, the scholar around china indicated that cases of COVID-19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory-confirmed [13]. And currently, several reports has reported the positive RT-PCR results for stool of COVID-19 patients 16,17 . Based on the infected patients can potentially shed the SARS-CoV2 through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, The value of RT-PCR results for stool in early diagnosis and monitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be study . .

Continuous variables were expressed as median and range deviation. The independent sample t-test and one-sample t-test were utilized to compare significant differences among continuous data. Statistical analysis of agreement was performed using McNemar Chi-squared test. It was regarded as statistical significance when the value was less than 0.05. We used R (version 3.5.0) for all analyses. Results The patients involved in this study summed 568, including 87 COVID-19 and 481 non-COVID19. All of them were the local residents of Wuhan, had a recent travel to Wuhan or contacted with people from Wuhan. And they were all eligible for the epidemiology criteria of suspected cases, and received further medical isolation, examination and diagnosis. Among the patients, 58.2% were males. Throughout the whole spectrum of age, 15-59 years group generates 60.6% of all populations in this study, and 5.7% of patients were aged below 15 years (Table 1 ). In the disease severity, 83.9% (73 of 87 patients) were mild and 16.1% (14 of 87 patients)were severe. In the early stage of COVID outbreak, RT-PCR and CT scan were the main measure for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence we collected the results of the two methods in the 568patints in further. In the period of Jan 17 th to Feb 11 th , total 1674 specimen from the 568 patients were detected by RT-PCR, which included 1415 pharyngeal and 259 stool (Table1). All patients after being admission received at least one RT-PCR detection for pharyngeal swabs, and 341 patients were subjected to the second RTPCR test for pharyngeal swabs. The stool detected by RT-PCR accounted to 259, 81 of which were from COVID-19 patients. Among the 568 patients, 364 patients were subjected to CT scan, .

The 568 cases being subjected to first RT-PCR and second RT-PCR for pharyngeal and 341 being subjected to CT scan were analyzed. The performance indexes were shown in Table1. The results showed that the sensitivity of RT-PCR in parallel with CT scan was the highest( 91.9%), which was higher than that of parallel with second nucleic acid (86.2%) (Table1). But the specificity of two nucleic acid detections was significantly higher than that of combination of nucleic acid and CT, suggesting that nucleic acid in parallel with CT was more appropriate to screen SARS-CoV-22 infections, and two nucleic acid tests for exclusion diagnosis maybe more suitable. It is reported that alive virus can survive in stool of COVID-19 patients. According our data, 8.6% patients (Table1) cannot be identified by combination of RT-PCR for pharyngeal swab and CT scan. Since that, can the RT-PCR test for stool be an efficiency assisting examination? In this study, there were 75 COVID-19 cases subjecting to stool nucleotide detection. Therefore, all of the RT-PCR results from 75 case with stool nucleotide detection were plotted along time axis (Figure3) . It was demonstrated that 35 cases had at least one positive results and the discovery rate is 46.7%. The stool presented earlier positive than the throat swab in two cases (patient No. 21, 38) (Figure3) . Moreover, pharyngeal swab of No.21 patient had been always negative until the end of the study. There were 16 patients with remaining positive results of stool after two consecutive negative results of pharyngeal swabs ( patient No.2,8,13,15,18,21,24,26,27,29,30,35,39,40,42,48) during their hospitalization (Figure3). Importantly, of the 14 discharged patients, two cases had stools being negative later than pharyngeal swabs (Patient No.2,10) (Figure3). The data above suggested that the detection of fecal nucleic acid could be employed to improve the discovery rate and might be developed as an indicator of monitoring and de-isolation. .

Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables appropriate treatment of infections. RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available. In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30%-50%) in the first assay. The reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include 26,27 : The first was samples, in some hospital, the patients' nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the SARS-CoV-2 separately. In our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial screening. We show that the strategy for the detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal and nasal swabs used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not perfect. We also found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. Based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, we applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate. Among the 87 laboratory-confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with RT-PCR results testing negative in the first assay. In the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not enough to be .

In the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. At last, technical factors, including virus mutation and PCR inhibition. In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was higher than that of the chest CT (78.5% vs 66.7%, respectively). The reasons for the relatively lower efficiency of chest CT is may include, 1) The major of COVID-19 patients was mild, in the early detection, there is no features or typical features of chest CT in our study. 2) We divided three groups in the 365 patients, one group is COVID-19 positive, the other group is COVID-19 negative. Our results support RT-PCR combine chest CT for first screening for COVID-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features.",Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
" The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell coexpression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ""CellPhoneDB"" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.",Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses
" Objective: We aim to summarize reliable evidences of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%. Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",Clinical characteristics of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection
" China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

" Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for 87.8%. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 ± 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 ± 0.43 and 1.55 ± 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001).

" In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.",ACE2 Expression in Kidney and Testis May Cause Kidney and Testis Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection
" The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity. To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 -4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.",Comparative genomic analysis revealed specific mutation pattern between human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13
" The flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) activates ribonuclease L (RNase L) catalytic antiviral 26 function during infection, yet deletion of RNase L decreases ZIKV production, suggesting 27 a proviral role of RNase L. In this study, we reveal that latent RNase L supports ZIKV 28 replication factory (RF) assembly. Deletion of RNase L induced broader cellular 29 distribution of ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 compared with densely concentrated RFs detected 30 in WT cells. An inactive form of RNase L was sufficient to contain ZIKV genome and 31 dsRNA within a smaller area, which increased levels of viral RNA within RFs as well as 32 infectious ZIKV released from the cell. We used a microtubule stabilization drug to 33 demonstrate that RNase L deletion impaired the cytoskeleton rearrangements that are 34 required for proper generation of RFs. During infection with dengue or West Nile Kunjin 35 viruses, RNase L decreased virus production, suggesting that RNase L proviral function 36 is specific to ZIKV. 37 38 39 Keywords 40 Zika virus, flavivirus, RNase L, replication factories, dengue virus, West Nile Kunjin virus 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 All rights reserved.

" Virophages are satellite-like double stranded DNA viruses whose replication requires the presence of two biological entities, a giant virus and a protist. In this report, we present the first evidence of host range expansion in a virophage. We demonstrated that the Guarani virophage was able to spontaneously expand its viral host range to replicate with two novel giant viruses that were previously nonpermissive to this virophage. We were able to characterize a potential genetic determinant of this cross-species infection. We then highlighted the relevant impact of this host adaptation on giant viruses and protists by demonstrating that coinfection with the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis. The results of our study help to elucidate the parasitic lifestyle of virophages and their interactions with giant viruses and protists. author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health and economic burden in affected countries. The availability of genomic data is key to understand viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR amplified viral sequences (targeted metagenomics), is the most informative approach to monitor the viral dissemination and genetic diversity. Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper reproducibility and comparison of results. Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerised and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV sequencing data, both from shotgun and targeted metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement of extensive bioinformatics expertise. Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples of varying serotype and genotype, including a spiked sample containing the existing four serotypes. The second dataset consisted of 106 targeted metagenomics samples of DENV 3 genotype III where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity. The DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM. The Dengue virus (DENV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus 2 genus, is one of the most prevalent arboviruses and is mainly concentrated in tropical and subtropical 3 regions. Infection with DENV results in symptoms ranging from mild fever to haemorrhagic fever and 4 shock syndrome [1]. Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes namely 5 Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus [2] In 2010, it was predicted that the burden of dengue disease 6 reached 390 million cases per year worldwide [3]. The high morbidity and mortality of dengue makes 7 it the arbovirus with the highest clinical significance [4]. 8 The viral genome of ∼11,000 nucleotides, consists of a Coding Sequence (CDS) of approximately 9 10.2 Kb that is translated into a single polyprotein encoding three structural proteins (capsid -C, 10 premembrane -prM, envelope -E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 11 NS4B and NS5. Additionally, the genome contains two Non-Coding Regions (NCRs) at their 5' and 12 3' ends [5]. DENV can be classified into four serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4), differing from each other by 25% to 14 40% at the amino acid level. They are further classified into genotypes that vary by up to ∼3% 15 at the amino acid level [2]. The DENV-1 serotype comprises five genotypes (I-V), DENV-2 groups 16 six (I-VI, also named American, Cosmopolitan, Asian-American, Asian II, Asian I and Sylvatic), 17 DENV-3 four (I-III and V), and DENV-4 also four (I-IV). 18 DENV is a significant public health challenge in countries where the infection is endemic due 19 to the high health and economic burden. Despite the emergence of novel therapies and ecological 20 strategies to control the mosquito vector, there are still important knowledge gaps in the virus biology 21 and its epidemiology [2]. The implementation of a surveillance system relying on High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) 23 technologies allows the simultaneous identification and surveillance of DENV cases. Due to the 24 high sensitivity of these technologies, previous studies showed that viral sequences can be directly 25 obtained from patient sera using a shotgun metagenomics approach [6]. Alternatively, HTS can be 26 used in a targeted metagenomics approach in which a PCR step is used to pre-amplify viral sequences 27 before sequencing. In recent years, HTS has been successfully used as a tool for identification of 28 DENV directly from clinical samples [6, 7]. This also allows the rapid identification of the serotype 29 and genotype important for disease management as the genotype may be associated with disease 30 outcome [8]. 31 Several initiatives aim to facilitate the identification of the DENV serotype and genotype from 32 HTS data. The Genome Detective project (https://www.genomedetective.com/) offers an online 33 Dengue Typing Tool (https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/dengue/) relying on 34 BLAST and phylogenetic methods in order to identify the closest serotype and genotype, but it 35 requires as input assembled genomes in FASTA format. Alternatively, the same project offers 36 a Genome Detective Typing Tool (https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/virus/) 37 identifying viruses present in a sample. We developed DEN-IM as a ready-to-use, one-stop, reproducible bioinformatic analysis workflow 39 for the processing and phylogenetic analysis of DENV using paired-end raw HTS data. DEN-IM is 40 implemented in Nextflow [9], a workflow manager software that uses Docker (https://www.docker. 41 com) containers with pre-installed software for all the workflow tools. The DEN-IM workflow, as well 42 as parameters and documentation, are available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM. 43 3 The DEN-IM Workflow 44 DEN-IM is a user-friendly automated workflow allowing the analysis of shotgun or targeted metage-45 nomics data for the identification, serotyping, genotyping, and phylogenetic analysis of DENV.

The workflow is composed of five blocks: 1. Quality Control and Trimming, 2. Retrieval of DENV 49 sequences, 3. Assembly, 4. in silico Typing, and 5. Phylogeny, described in more detail in Figure 1 . 50 DEN-IM accepts as input raw paired-end sequencing data (FASTQ files), and informs the user with 51 an interactive HTML report with information on the quality control, mapping, assembly typing and 52 phylogenetic analysis, as well as all the output files of the whole pipeline. 53 3.1 1. Quality Control and Trimming 54 The Quality Control (QC) and Trimming block starts with a process to verify the integrity of the 55 input data. If the sequencing files are corrupted, the execution of the analysis of that sample is 56 terminated. 57 The sequences are then processed by FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ 58 projects/fastqc/, version 0.11.7) to determine the quality of the individual base pairs of the 59 raw data files. The low quality bases and adapter sequences are trimmed by Trimmomatic [10] 60 (version 0.36). By default, Trimmomatic removes the Illumina Nextera, TruSeq2 and TruSeq3 adapter 61 sequences that are detected, and relies on Phred scores [11] and FastQC analysis data to determine 62 to which extend the 5' and 3' ends of the reads need to be trimmed. The crop and headcrop setting 63 is calculated per sample, based on the GC ratio of each half of the read. By default, the window size 64 is set to 5 nucleotides with a minimum average quality of 20. In addition, paired-end reads with a 65 read length shorter than 55 nucleotides after trimming are removed from further analyses. 66 Lastly, the low complexity sequences, containing over 50% of poly-A, poly-N or poly-T nucleotides, 67 are filtered out of the raw data using PrinSeq [12] (version 0.10.4). 68 3.2 2. Retrieval of DENV Sequences 69 In the second step, DENV sequences are selected from the sample using Bowtie2 [13] (version 70 2.2.9) and Samtools [14] (version 1.4.1). As a reference we provide the DENV mapping database, a 71 curated DENV database composed of 3830 complete DENV genomes (see Methods, DENV Reference 72 Database). A permissive approach is followed by allowing for mates to be kept in the sample even 73 when only one read maps to the database in order to keep as many DENV derived reads as possible. The output of this step is a set of processed reads of putative DENV origin. 75 3.3 3. Assembly 76 DEN-IM applies a two assembler approach to generate assemblies of the DENV CDS. To obtain a 77 high confidence assembly, the processed reads are first de novo assembled with SPAdes [15] (version 78 3.12.0). If the full CDS fails to be assembled into a single contig, the data is re-assembled with 79 MEGAHIT assembler [16] (version 1.1.3), a more permissive assembler developed to retrieve longer 80 sequences from metagenomics data. The resulting assemblies are corrected with Pilon [17] (version 81 1.22) after mapping the processed reads to the assemblies with Bowtie2 [13]. 82 If more than one complete CDS is present in a sample, each of the sequences will follow the rest 83 of the DEN-IM workflow independently. If no full CDS is assembled neither with SPAdes nor with 84 MEGAHIT, the processed reads are passed on to the next step for consensus generation by mapping, 85 effectively constituting DEN-IM's two pronged approach using both assemblers and mapping. 86 3.4 4. Typing 87 For each DENV complete CDS, the serotype and genotype is determined with the Seq Typing tool 88 (https://github.com/B-UMMI/seq_typing, version 2.0) [18] using BLAST [19] and the custom 89 Typing database of DENV containing 161 complete sequences (see Methods, DENV Reference 90 Database). The BLAST results are first cleaned to get the best hit for each sequence in the database, 91 based on alignment length, similarity, e-value and number of gaps. The tool determines which 92 reference sequence is more closely related to the query based on the identity and length of the 93 sequence covered, returning the serotype and genotype of the reference sequence for the purpose of 94 classifying the query. If a complete CDS fails to be obtained through the assembly process, the processed reads are 96 mapped against the DENV typing database, with Bowtie2 [13], using Seq Typing tool, with similar 97 criteria for coverage and identity to those used with the BLAST approach. If a type is determined, 98 the consensus sequence obtained follows through to the next step in the workflow. Otherwise, the 99 sample is classified as Non-Typable and its process terminated. 100 3.5 5. Phylogeny 101 All DENV complete CDSs and consensus sequences analysed in a workflow execution are aligned 102 with MAFFT [20] (version 7.402), in auto mode and with orientation being automatically determined 103 and adjusted. With the resulting alignment, a Maximum Likelihood tree is inferred with RaXML [21] 104 (version 8.2.11), using as default the GTR-Γ substitution model and a 500 times bootstrap. 105 Optionally, the closest reference sequence in the DENV typing database to each analysed sample 106 can be retrieved and included in the phylogenetic analysis. 107 4 Workflow Execution 108 The DEN-IM workflow can be executed in any UNIX-based system, from local machines to high-109 performance computing clusters (HPC) facilities with Nextflow and a container engine installation, 110 such as Docker (https://www.docker.com/, Shifter [22] or Singularity [23]. 111 Due to its Nextflow implementation, DEN-IM allows for out-of-the-box high-level parallelization 112 and offers direct support for distributed computational environments. DEN-IM integrates Docker 113 containerised images for all the tools necessary for its execution, ensuring reproducibility and the 114 tracking of both software code and version, regardless of the operating system used. The Docker 115 images provided are also compatible with other container engines. 116 Users can customise the workflow execution either by using command line options or by modifying 117 a simple plain-text configuration file (params.config). The version of each of the tools used in 118 DEN-IM can be changed by providing new container tags in the appropriate configuration file 119 (containers.config). The resources for each process can also be changed (resources.config). To make 120 the execution of the workflow as simple as possible, a set of default parameters and directives is 121 provided. 122 The local installation of the DEN-IM workflow, including the docker containers with all the tools 123 needed and the curated DENV database, requires 15 Gigabytes of free disk space. The minimum 124 requirements to execute the workflow are at least 5 Gigabytes of memory and 4 CPUs, although 7 125 Gigabytes of memory is advised. The disk space required for execution depends greatly on the size 126 of the input data, but for the datasets used in this article DEN-IM generates approximately 20 Gb 127 data per Gb of input data. 128 5 Output and Report 129 The output files of all tools are stored in the 'results' folder in the directory of the DEN-IM execution. 130 The execution log file for each component, as well as a log file for the execution of the workflow, are 131 also available. 132 DEN-IM creates an interactive HTML report (Figure S1), stored in the 'pipeline results' directory, 133 containing all the information in the results divided into four sections: report overview, tables, charts 134 and phylogenetic tree. The report can be easily exchanged between collaborators by compressing 135 and sharing the ""pipeline report"" folder. 136 The report overview contains information about the number of samples in the analysis. It allows 137 for selection, filtering and highlighting of particular samples and tools in the workflow. 138 The table section contains the results and statistics the quality control, assembly, read mapping 139 and in silico typing results. The in silico typing table contains the results of the serotype and 140 genotype of each CDS analysed, as well as identity and coverage and GenBank ID for the closest 141 reference in the DENV typing database. doi: bioRxiv preprint 206 was generated.

" Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. We included 710 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.

" 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China. Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.",Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening

" Advanced biomaterials provide versatile ways to spatially and temporally control immune cell activity, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potency and safety. Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform -biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies.

" There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans. author/funder.

" Understanding interspecific viral transmission is key to understanding viral ecology and evolution, 12 disease spillover into humans, and the consequences of global change. Prior work has 13 demonstrated that macroecological factors drive viral sharing in some mammalian groups, 14 but analyses have never attempted to predict viral sharing in a pan-mammalian context. Here 15 we show that host phylogenetic similarity and geographic range overlap are strong, nonlinear 16 predictors of viral sharing among species across the entire mammal class.

" Synthetic biology based diagnostic technologies have improved upon gold standard diagnostic methodologies by decreasing cost, increasing accuracy, and enhancing portability. However there has been little effort in adapting these technologies towards applications related to point-of-use monitoring of plant and crop health. Here, we take a step towards this vision by developing an approach that couples isothermal amplification of specific plant pathogen genomic sequences with customizable synthetic RNA regulators that are designed to trigger the production of a colorimetric output in cell-free gene expression reactions. We demonstrate our system can sense viral derived sequences with high-sensitivity and specificity, and can be utilized to directly detect viruses from infected plant material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the entire system can operate using only body heat and naked-eye visual analysis of outputs.

Yet, surprisingly little is known 25 about the impact of routine interpersonal contacts in shaping microbiome composition.

We find that women harbor 31 strains more closely related to those harbored by their familial and social contacts than men; and that 32 transmission patterns of oral-and gut-associated microbiota need not be the same.

" Natural selection acting on synonymous mutations in protein-coding genes influences genome composition and evolution. In viruses, introducing synonymous mutations in genes encoding structural proteins can drastically reduce viral growth, providing a means to generate potent, live attenuated vaccine candidates. However, an improved understanding of what compositional features are under selection and how combinations of synonymous mutations affect viral growth is needed to predictably attenuate viruses and make them resistant to reversion. We systematically recoded all non-overlapping genes of the bacteriophage ΦX174 with codons rarely used in its E. coli host. The fitness of recombinant viruses decreases as additional deoptimizing mutations are made to the genome, although not always linearly, and not consistently across genes. Combining deoptimizing mutations may reduce viral fitness more or less than expected from the effect size of the constituent mutations and we point out difficulties in untangling correlated compositional features. We test our model by optimizing the same genes and find that the relationship between codon usage and fitness does not hold for optimization, suggesting that wild-type ΦX174 is at a fitness optimum. This work highlights the need to better understand how selection acts on patterns of synonymous codon usage across the genome and provides a convenient system to investigate the genetic determinants of virulence. : bioRxiv preprint host-phage relationships that are too short-lived for selection to fine tune codon usage in the phage, or inadequate understanding of the features under selection. Empirically developed (e.g. serial passage viral adaptation) vaccines have saved millions of lives over the last century, yet methodological improvements make rationally designed, recombinant vaccines attractive because they can be rapidly produced and specifically engineered for safety and effectiveness (46-50) . One proposed method of generating recombinant vaccines involves making many synonymous, attenuating changes to viral genomes, i.e. ""deoptimizing"" the viral genes (51) . The recombinant vaccine can be made by either editing the genome of the wild-type virus or by generating a viral genome entirely from synthesized nucleic acids. Synonymous deoptimization offers a potentially efficient and effective way of making vaccines: the protein sequences of recoded vaccines are identical to their target viruses, they replicate in their host to provide prolonged exposure to the antigen, and the introduction of many synonymous changes presumably assures evolutionary robustness, preventing the evolution of virulence by reversion. Poliovirus serves as a very good example for the synonymous recoding strategy. Development of a robust, live-attenuated poliovirus vaccine is desired because in some areas on Earth wild poliovirus and the emergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continues to cause concern over the resurgence of poliomyelitis (52-55) . A synthetic poliovirus was assembled in 2002 (56) , codon deoptimized in 2006 (57, 58) , codon pair deoptimized in 2008 (59) , and dinucleotide deoptimized in 2009 (11) . In all cases, attenuated viruses were produced by recoding the P1/capsid region of the genome. In vitro , these viruses replicate slower and produce lower viral titers than wild-type virus. In vivo the codon pair deoptimized strain protected mice against challenge by wild poliovirus (59) . While the mechanism of attenuation is not yet fully elucidated, reduced protein expression of the deoptimized genes is observed (11, 57-59) . These deoptimized poliovirus constructs are genetically stable and remain non-virulent for up to 25 passages in cell culture (57, 59) . The apparent success of building poliovirus vaccine candidates using synonymous recoding led to similar attempts to develop vaccines for influenza, adeno-associated, human immunodeficiency, papilloma, chikungunya, respiratory syncytial, simian immunodeficiency,",ΦX174 Attenuation by Whole Genome Codon Deoptimization
" On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R 0 , to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.",A PREPRINT

" The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals' recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.

" Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions.

" A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number "" settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high "" , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low "" , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low "" (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher "" (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections. .

" Extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposits and inflammatory immune activation are thought to alter various aspects of tissue microstructure, such as extracellular free water, fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, as well as the density and geometric arrangement of axonal processes. Quantifying these microstructural changes in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementias could serve to accurately monitor or predict disease course. In the present study we used high-field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to determine how Aβ and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6), alone or in combination, affect in vivo tissue microstructure in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's-type Aβ deposition. TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (nTg) mice expressing brain-targeted IL6 or enhanced glial fibrillary protein (EGFP controls) were scanned at 8 months of age using a 2-shell, 54-gradient direction dMRI sequence at 11.1 Tesla. Images were processed using the free water elimination method and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. DTI and NODDI processing in TgCRND8 mice revealed a microstructure pattern consistent with reduced white matter integrity along with an increase in density and geometric complexity of axonal and dendritic processes. This included reduced FA, mean diffusivity (MD), and free water (FW), and increased 'neurite' density (NDI) and orientation dispersion (ODI). IL6 produced a 'protective-like' effect on FA in TgCRND8 mice, although there were minimal microstructure changes in these mice compared IL6 expressing nTg mice. In addition, we found that NDI and ODI had an inverse relationship with the functional connectome clustering coefficient, which was affected by Aβ and IL6. The relationship between NODDI and graph theory metrics suggests that increasing the density and orientation dispersion of neurites may relate to diminished functional network organization in the brain.",Increased Neurite Orientation-Dispersion and Density in the TgCRND8 Mouse Model of Amyloidosis: Inverse Relation with Functional Connectome Clustering and Modulation

We posit that the current phylogenetic protocol is missing two critical steps, and that their absence allows model misspecification and confirmation bias to unduly influence our phylogenetic estimates.

In reality, many researchers analyze their data using a range of model-based phylogenetic methods, and reports that only use parsimony methods are increasingly rare.

This choice is often made by using model-selection methods (6,86-97). Having chosen a phylogenetic method and, in relevant cases, a suitable model of sequence evolution, the next step involves obtaining accurate estimates of the tree and evolutionary processes that led to the data.

" The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22).

" Infectious-disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproductive number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size. Directly estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval -the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r-R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.",A practical generation interval-based approach to inferring the strength of epidemics from their speed Keywords Infectious disease modeling; Generation interval; basic reproductive number 1
" Schizophrenia is an idiopathic disorder that affects approximately 1% of the human population, and presents with persistent delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors. Antipsychotics are the standard pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia, but are frequently discontinued by patients due to inefficacy and/or side effects. Chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol causes tardive dyskinesia (TD), which manifests as involuntary and often irreversible orofacial movements in around 30% of patients. Mice treated with haloperidol develop many of the features of TD, including jaw tremors, tongue protrusions, and vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). In this study, we used genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred inter-cross (RIX) mice to elucidate the genetic basis of antipsychoticinduced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines (derived from 62 CC strains) treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. We used linear mixed models to test for strain and treatment effects. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (p<0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, particularly for changes in distance traveled, vertical activity, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Estimates of overall heritability ranged from 0.21 (change in body weight) to 0.4 (VCMs and change in distance traveled) while the portion attributable to the interactions of treatment and strain ranged from 0.01 (for change in body weight) to 0.15 (for change in EPS). Interestingly, close to 30% of RIX mice exhibited VCMs, a sensitivity to haloperidol exposure, approximately similar to the rate of TD in humans chronically exposed to haloperidol.",Antipsychotic behavioral phenotypes in the mouse Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred inter-crosses (RIX)
" Manipulation of natural mosquito populations using the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is being 21 investigated as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne viruses. To evaluate the 22 efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in 23 Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this 24 need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low 25 sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and 26 technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, 27 we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand 28 displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform 29 for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids 30 from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single 31 endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We 32 demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome 33 oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection 34 of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the 35 coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti 36 mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37 °C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-37 OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus 38 mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, 39 minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-40 cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited 41 conditions. 42 43 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Mosquitoes spread many human pathogens and novel approaches are required to reduce the 45 burden of mosquito-borne disease. One promising approach is transferring Wolbachia into 46 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes where it blocks transmission of arboviruses like dengue, Zika and 47 Yellow fever viruses and spreads through mosquito populations. For effective evaluation of this 48 approach, regular surveillance of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti is required, but current 49 diagnostic tools are not well suited to support these critical surveillance needs. To fill this need 50 we developed a simple, robust and inexpensive assay to identify Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and 51 Wolbachia using our unique one-pot assay platform, LAMP-OSD, which uses loop-mediated 52 isothermal amplification to amplify nucleic acid targets at a single temperature. Unlike other 53 LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid 54 strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification 55 products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye 56 and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are 57 compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid 58 extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone 59 tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C 60 while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay 61 could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. 62 Our easy to use and easy to interpret assays should facilitate widespread field mosquito 63 surveillance with minimal instrumentation and high accuracy. 64 65 66 All rights reserved.

On the other end of the spectrum, immunoassay-based tools for identifying pathogen-93 infected mosquitoes, such as VecTest TM dipsticks (Medical Analysis Systems Inc.), are portable 94 and inexpensive. However, these tests have poor sensitivity [23-25] and are not necessarily 95 available for distinguishing mosquito species or identifying Wolbachia endosymbionts. 96 Nucleic acid tests can provide the necessary sensitivity and versatility for identifying both 97 Wolbachia and mosquito species. However, since molecular testing is currently heavily reliant on 98 PCR [26-28], opportunities for field-based determinations are limited, leading to significant delays 99 and gaps in actionable surveillance. To support widespread vector surveillance inexpensive, 100 portable, nucleic acid diagnostic platforms are needed that rapidly produce accurate results without 101 requiring complex procedures, instruments, and laboratory infrastructure. In this regard, isothermal 102 nucleic acid amplification assays such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have 103 begun to be employed because they do not require complex thermocycling instruments [29][30][31]. 104 However, although LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity it often produces spurious amplicons, which 105 in turn lead to false positive readouts with non-specific reporters such as Mg 2+ precipitation or 106 fluorescent dye intercalation [32][33][34]. 107 To mitigate the spurious signals that arise with LAMP, we have previously applied principles that 108 were developed for nucleic acid strand exchange circuits [35][36][37][38] to the design of short hemiduplex 109 oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes for LAMP [39]. The single stranded 'toehold' 110 regions of OSD probes bind to LAMP amplicon loop sequences, and then signal via strand 111 exchange [40] that leads to separation of a fluorophore and quencher [39]. OSDs are the 112 functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and can specifically report single or multiplex LAMP 113 amplicons without interference from non-specific nucleic acids or inhibitors [39, 41]. OSDs 114 significantly enhance the diagnostic applicability of LAMP, allowing it to match the allelic specificity 115 All rights reserved.

" Viral gain-of-function mutations are commonly observed in the laboratory; however, it is unknown whether those mutations also evolve in nature. We identify two key residues in the host recognition protein of bacteriophage l that are necessary to exploit a new receptor; both residues repeatedly evolved among homologs from environmental samples. Our results provide evidence for widespread host-shift evolution in nature and a proof of concept for integrating experiments with genomic epidemiology. Many viruses can expand their host range with a few mutations 1-3 that enable the exploitation of new cellular receptors 2,3 . Such mutations may be the first steps toward an epidemic outbreak; this observation has driven an expansion of theoretical 4 , experimental and surveillance studies of host-range shifts in emergent pathogens, including avian influenza 5-8 , coronaviruses 9,10 , HIV 11 and ebolavirus 12 . Ideally, laboratory evolution experiments could be used to accelerate our understanding of how viruses expand their host range. However, it is not clear whether viral evolution observed under the chemical and physical environments of a laboratory can faithfully inform us about viral evolution in nature, for at least two reasons. First, evolutionary trajectories might be sensitive to differences in environmental conditions between the laboratory and nature. Second, the number of evolutionary paths sampled in laboratory experiments is very small compared to natural virus diversity due to the enormous size of viral All rights reserved.

" Recently developed quantitative redox proteomic studies enable the direct identification of redox-sensing cysteine residues that regulate the functional behavior of target proteins in response to changing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the molecular level, redox regulation can directly modify the active sites of enzymes, although a growing number of examples indicate the importance of an additional underlying mechanism that involves conditionally disordered proteins. These proteins alter their functional behavior by undergoing a disorder-to-order transition in response to changing redox conditions. However, the extent to which this mechanism is used in various proteomes is currently unknown. Here, we use a recently developed sequence-based prediction tool incorporated into the IUPred2A web server to estimate redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions on a large scale. We show that redox-sensitive conditional disorder is fairly widespread in various proteomes and that its presence strongly correlates with the expansion of specific domains in multicellular organisms that largely rely on extra stability provided by disulfide bonds or zinc ion binding. The analyses of yeast redox proteomes and human disease data further underlie the significance of this phenomenon in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, as well as its biomedical importance.",Large-scale analysis of redox-sensitive conditionally disordered protein regions reveal their widespread nature and key roles in high-level eukaryotic processes
" Background: All types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) are caused by the aberrant myogenic activation of the somatically silent DUX4 gene, which initiates a cascade of cellular events ultimately leading to FSHD pathophysiology. Therefore, FSHD is a dominant gain-of-function disease that is amenable to modeling by DUX4 overexpression. However, there is large variability in the patient population. Typically, progressive skeletal muscle weakness becomes noticeable in the second or third decade of life, yet there are many genetically FSHD individuals who develop symptoms much later in life or remain relatively asymptomatic throughout their lives. Conversely, in rare cases, FSHD may present clinically prior to 5-10 yrs of age, ultimately manifesting as a very severe early onset form of the disease. Thus, there is a need to control the timing and severity of pathology in FSHD-like models. Methods: We have recently described a line of conditional DUX4 transgenic mice, FLExDUX4, that develop a myopathy upon induction of human DUX4-fl expression in skeletal muscle. Here, we use the FLExDUX4 mouse crossed with the skeletal muscle-specific and tamoxifen inducible line ACTA1-MerCreMer to generate a highly versatile bi-transgenic mouse model with chronic, lowlevel DUX4-fl expression and mild pathology, that can be induced to develop more severe FSHD-like pathology in a dose-dependent response to tamoxifen. We identified conditions to reproducibly generate models exhibiting mild, moderate, or severe DUX4-dependent pathophysiology, and characterized their progression. Results: We assayed DUX4-fl mRNA and protein levels, fitness, strength, global gene expression, histopathology, and immune response, all of which are consistent with an FSHD-like myopathic phenotype. Importantly, we identified sex-specific and muscle-specific differences that should be considered when using these models for preclinical studies. Conclusions: The ACTA1-MCM;FLExDUX4 bi-transgenic mouse model expresses a chronic low level of DUX4-fl and has mild pathology and detectable muscle weakness. The onset and progression of moderate to severe pathology can be controlled via tamoxifen injection to provide consistent and readily screenable phenotypes for assessing therapies targeting DUX4-fl mRNA and protein. Thus, these FSHD-like mouse models can be used to study a range of DUX4-fl expression and pathology dependent upon investigator need, through controlled mosaic expression of DUX4. In addition to the complex genetic and epigenetic conditions that are required to develop clinical FSHD, the pathogenic mechanism is also unusual among neuromuscular diseases. While FSHD is an autosomal dominant gain-of-function disease, the pathogenic DUX4 gene is typically expressed in only a small fraction (<1%) of myocytes, ultimately leading to debilitating muscle pathology over time [8, 16, 26]. This may account in part for the more common adult onset of clinical symptoms in FSHD patients [27, 28] . In addition, it appears that FSHD pathology is caused by sporadic bursts of increased DUX4-fl expression in differentiated myocytes, which are epigenetically suppressed in healthy and asymptomatic subjects [9, 19, 29] . Since these cells are syncytial, the detrimental effects of aberrant DUX4-FL expression may be found throughout an FSHD myofiber despite expression initially being restricted to a small percentage of myonuclei at any one time [26]. Regardless, DUX4-fl expression in FSHD myocytes and skeletal muscle, even when bursting, is still extremely rare, highly variable, and difficult to detect [8, 16, 19] . Since DUX4-FL is a transcription factor not typically expressed in healthy muscle, its aberrant expression alters the mRNA profiles of numerous genes in myocytes [24, 30, 31] . Many of these DUX4 target genes, including germline specific genes, cleavage stage genes, and immune system regulators, are not normally expressed in healthy myogenic cells [22, 24, 30, 31 ]. In addition, DUX4-FL expression ultimately initiates a cascade of numerous potentially detrimental events including the disruption of proteostasis, nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA splicing mechanisms [19, 32, 33] , altered myogenesis [34, 35] , and induction of apoptosis [19, [36] [37] [38] . These DUX4-mediated changes, either alone or in combination, lead to progressive muscle cell death and ultimately pathology [10, 18] . Thus, the DUX4-fl mRNA and protein are prime targets for therapeutic intervention, and animal models for FSHD should be based on DUX4-fl expression in adult skeletal muscle. We have previously reported the generation of the FLExDUX4 (FLExD) conditional DUX4-fl transgenic line of mice, which contains a DUX4 transgene engineered into the Rosa26 locus using the FLEx directional switch system [39, 40] to bypass the embryonic lethality from leaky embryonic expression of this transgene [41] . Upon Cre-mediated induction, the transgene recombines to express DUX4-fl under control of the Rosa26 gene promoter ( Figure 1A ). Importantly, since many elements within DUX4 are prime targets for sequence-based therapies [42] [43] [44] [45] , the DUX4 transgene maintains the exon/intron structure of the endogenous human gene, Male ACTA1-MCM mice were crossed with female Rosa26 NZG mice to assess induction of Cremediated recombination using our TMX dosage regimens. Control or bi-transgenic mice were treated with TMX, as above.

" Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists.

" population. We report that domestication of the model yeast S. cerevisiae reprogrammed its life cycle entirely. We tracked growth, gamete formation and cell survival across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced isolates and found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. Wild yeasts near uniformly trigger meiosis and sporulate when encountering nutrient depletions, whereas domestication relaxed selection on sexual reproduction and favoured survival as quiescent cells. Domestication also systematically enhanced fermentative over respiratory traits while decreasing stress tolerance. We show that this yeast domestication syndrome was driven by aneuploidies and gene function losses that emerged independently in multiple domesticated lineages during the specie's recent evolutionary history. We found domestication to be the most dramatic event in budding yeast evolution, raising questions on how much domestication has distorted our understanding of this key model species.",Domestication reprogrammed the budding yeast life cycle

" Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how 15 the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating an organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the 20 virus's conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, and could contribute to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV. 35",Influenza A virus surface proteins are organized to help penetrate host mucus
" Many recombinant vector vaccines are capable of replication within the host. They consist of a 5 fully competent vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the 6 perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be intrinsically 7 detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete the transgene may evolve to dominate the within-8 host population and in doing so reduce the antigenicity of the vaccine. We apply mathematical and 9 computational models to study this process, including the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth 10 plus the dynamics of innate and adaptive immunity. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is 11 easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that, despite possible 12 fitness differences between vaccine and revertant, the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the 13 short period of growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant per se does not 14 interfere with immunity to vaccine except as the revertant suppresses vaccine abundance; the magnitude 15 of this interference depends on mechanisms and timing of viral suppression. Adaptive immunity targeting 16 the foreign antigen is also a possible basis of vaccine inferiority, but it is not worsened by vaccine evolution. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes matter to the adaptive immune response 18 targeting the foreign antigen, but even when it does matter, simple principles of vaccine design and the 19 control of inoculum composition can largely mitigate the effects. 20 Author Summary 21 Recombinant vector vaccines are live replicating viruses that are engineered to carry extra genes derived from 22 a pathogen -and these produce proteins against which we want to generate immunity. These genes may 23 evolve to be lost during the course of replication within an individual, and there is a concern that this can 24 severely limit the vaccine's efficacy. The dynamics of this process are studied here with mathematical models. The potential for vaccine evolution is somewhat reduced by the short-term growth of the vaccine population 26 before it is suppressed by the immune response.

" The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were crucial.

" The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). A range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in early January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23 rd January. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across Hubei Province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay of COVID-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5). Questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to locations outside of Wuhan.

" Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like-illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches. It is estimated that there are between 3 and 5 million worldwide annual seasonal cases 1 of severe influenza illness, and between 290 000 and 650 000 respiratory deaths [1]. 2 Influenza-like-illness (ILI) describes a set of symptoms and is a practical way for 3 health-care workers to easily estimate likely influenza cases. The Centers for Disease 4 Control (CDC) collects and disseminates ILI information, and has, for the last several 5 years, run a forecasting challenge (the CDC Flu Challenge) for modelers to predict 6 near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. 7 We have developed a modeling framework that accounts for a range of mechanisms 8 thought to be important for influenza transmission, such as climatic conditions, school 9 vacations, and coupling between different regions. In this study we describe our forecast 10 procedure for the 2016-17 season and highlight which features of our models resulted in 11 better or worse forecasts. Most notably, we found that when the dynamics of different 12 regions are coupled together, the forecast accuracy improves. We also found that the 13 most accurate forecasts required some level of forecaster interaction, that is, the 14 procedure could not be completely automated without a reduction in accuracy.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/309021 doi: bioRxiv preprint Infectious pathogens with short generation times pose public health challenges because 17 they generate substantial near-term uncertainty in the risk of disease. This uncertainty 18 is most acute and shared globally during the initial stages of emergence of novel human 19 pathogens such as SARS [2], pandemic influenza [3], or the Zika virus [4] . However, at 20 national and sub-national levels, uncertainty arises frequently for epidemic pathogens 21 such as seasonal influenza, dengue, RSV and rotavirus; causing problems both for 22 health planners and at-risk individuals who may consider changing their behavior to 23 mitigate their risk during peak periods. 24 Seasonal influenza affects populations in all global regions and is forecast annually in 25 temperate populations, either implicitly or explicitly [5]. Peak demand for both 26 outpatient and inpatient care is driven by peak incidence of influenza in many years [6]. 27 Therefore, the efficient provision of elective procedures and other non-seasonal health 28 care can be improved by accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza. Implicitly, most 29 temperate health systems use knowledge of historical scenarios with which to plan for 30 their influenza season. The current situation is then assessed against the deviation from 31 the historical averages and worst-cases as observed in their own surveillance system. The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has sought to formalize regional 33 and national forecasts by introducing an annual competition [7] . Each week, 34 participating teams submit weekly estimates of incidence for the next four weeks, season 35 onset, and timing and intensity of the peak. Methods used by teams include purely 36 statistical models, [8-10] mechanistic models [11, 12] machine learning and hybrid 37 approaches [13-15]. Expert-opinion surveys have also been used and performed well. 38 Some teams augment their forecasts of the official ILI data with the use of potentially 39 faster or less-noisy datasets such as google flu trends [16]. 40 Here we describe a our mechanistic-model-supported participation in the 2016-17 CDC 41 influenza forecasting challenge, as an example of a disease forecasting process. We 42 emphasize a subjective human component of this process and also describe a 43 retrospective evaluation of the models for the previous six seasons. All the models 44 PLOS 3/43 .

Fig S1 51 shows which states are grouped into each HHS region, along with the population of each 52 region. Because we require an absolute number of cases per week, the CDC ILINet data 53 is converted from percent ILI cases per patient to ILI cases. We estimate the absolute 54 number of weekly ILI cases by dividing the weighted percent of ILI cases in the CDC 55 data by 100 and multiplying it by the total weekly number of patients. We assume two 56 outpatient visits per person per year so that the total weekly number of patients is 57 estimated as: (total regional population)x(2 outpatient visits per person per year)x(1 58 year/52 weeks). 59 The estimate of two outpatient visits per year is based on two studies. In 2006 60 Schappert and Burt [18] studied the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys 61 (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS) 62 and calculated an ambulatory rate of 3.8 visits per capita-year. The 2011 NAMCS [19] 63 and NHAMCS surveys [20] estimated ambulatory visit rates of 3.32 visits per capita per 64 year for physician's offices, 0.43 for hospital emergency departments and 0.33 hospital 65 Outpatient Departments. We sum these rates to get an outpatient visit per capita-year 66 of 4.08. We further estimate from the surveys that only half of these outpatient clinics 67 are sites that report to ILINet, and hence we rounded to our two outpatient visits per 68 year estimate. 69 Specific humidity (SH) is measured in units of kg per kg and is defined as the ratio of 70 PLOS 4/43 .

The weekly data is then spatially-averaged for the states and CDC 77 regions. 78 School vacation schedules were collected for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 academic years for 79 every state. For each state, a school district was identified to represent each of the three 80 largest cities. Vacation schedules were then collected directly from the district websites. 81 These three school vacation schedules were first processed to a weekly schedule with a 82 value of 0 indicating class was in session all five weekdays and a 1 indicating five 83 vacation days. Next, the representative state schedule was produced by averaging the 84 three weekly district schedules. Region schedules are obtained by a population-weighted 85 average of the state schedules. Similarly, the national schedule is generated by a 86 population-weighted average of the regions. 87 For the 2016-17 season we determine start and end times as well as spring and fall 88 breaks from the previous years schedules.

" 19 Base J, β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA 20 Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how 21 specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription 22 termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-23 glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass 24 spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein 25 (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate 26 JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, 27 JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian 28 PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. 29 Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of 30 PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3'-end of polycistronic gene arrays in 31 Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, 32 suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In 33 addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for 34 host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation 35 of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating 36 polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids. 37 38 Author Summary 39 Trypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping 40 sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain 41 multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence 42 of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene 43 clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of 44 downstream genes. We now identify a novel stable multimeric complex containing a J binding protein .

A similar complex (PTW/PP1) has been shown to be involved 47 in Pol II termination in humans and yeast. We demonstrate that PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 mutants lead 48 to read-through transcription in T. brucei. Our data suggest the PJW/PP1 complex regulates termination 49 by recruitment to termination sites via JBP3-base J interactions and dephosphorylation of specific 50 proteins (including Pol II and termination factors) by PP1. These findings significantly expand our 51 understanding of mechanisms underlying transcription termination in eukaryotes, including divergent 52 organisms that utilize polycistronic transcription and novel epigenetic marks such as base J and H3.V. The studies also provide the first direct mechanistic link between J modification of DNA at termination 54 sites and regulated Pol II termination and gene expression in kinetoplastids. 56 Introduction Termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process 58 where the polymerase stops RNA chain elongation and dissociates from the end of the gene or 59 transcription unit. However, the underlying termination mechanism is not fully understood. In typical 60 eukaryotes, Pol II termination of protein-coding genes is tightly linked to the processing of the nascent 61 transcript 3' end (reviewed in (1)). This association ensures complete formation of stable polyadenylated 62 mRNA products and prevents the elongating Pol II complex from interfering with transcription of 63 downstream genes. Transcription through the polyadenylation site results in an exchange of transcription 64 factors, resulting in the regulation of the elongation-to-termination transition, in an ordered series of 65 events: 1) dissociation of the elongation factor Spt5, 2) Pol II pausing, 3) changes in phosphorylation 66 status of Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), which promotes 4) recruitment of cleavage factors and 67 termination factors, 5) transcript cleavage and 6) termination by the 5'-3' 'torpedo' exoribonuclease 68 XRN2/Rat1. Critical to this process is the regulation of protein phosphorylation by the major eukaryotic protein 70 serine/threonine phosphatase, PP1. As recently demonstrated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces 71 pombe (S. pombe), the PP1 phosphatase Dis2 regulates termination by de-phosphorylating both Thr4P of .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 72 the Pol II-CTD as well as Spt5 (2). This PP1-dependent dephosphorylation allows the efficient recruitment 73 of the termination factor Seb1 as well as decreased Spt5 stimulation of Pol II elongation that enhances 74 the capture by the torpedo exoribonuclease. Transcription termination was also affected in the S. 75 cerevisiae PP1 isotype Glc7 mutant (3). PP1 action is modulated through the formation of heteromeric 76 complexes with specific regulatory subunits (4). These regulatory protein subunits regulate PP1 by 77 targeting the protein to specific subcellular compartments, to particular substrates, or reduce its activity 78 towards potential substrates. The vast majority of regulators are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 79 and bind PP1 via a primary PP1-binding motif, the RVxF motif (4-6). One of the key PP1 regulatory 80 proteins in the nucleus is the PP1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) (7, 8). PNUTS is a multidomain 81 protein defined by the canonical PP1 RVxF interaction motif. It also has an N-terminal domain that 82 interacts with the DNA binding protein Tox4 and a domain near the C-terminus that interacts with Wdr82 83 (9). This stable multimeric complex in humans is named the PTW/PP1 complex. Targeting of the complex 84 to chromatin is presumably due in part through associations with Tox4. While the function of Wdr82 in this 85 complex is not known, it may mediate interactions with Pol II by recognizing Ser5-phosphorylated CTD, 86 as it does when it is associated with the Set1 complex (10). In yeast, PP1 is associated with PNUTS and 87 Wdr82 homologs in APT, a subcomplex of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (11-14), and their 88 deletion caused termination defects at Pol II-dependent genes (15, 16). In mammals, PNUTS and Wdr82 89 mutant cells have defects in transcription termination at the 3' end of genes and 5' antisense transcription 90 at bi-directional promoters (17). Members of the Kinetoplastida order include the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei that causes 92 African Sleeping sickness. Kinetoplastids are early-diverged protozoa with unique genome arrangements 93 where genes are organized into polycistronic transcription units (PTU) that are transcribed by Pol II. Pre-94 messenger RNAs (mRNA) are processed to mature mRNA with the addition of a 5' spliced leader 95 sequence through trans-splicing, followed by 3' polyadenylation (reviewed in (18)). Given the close 96 relationship between poly(A) processing and transcription termination in other eukaryotes, it is not clear 97 how multiple functional poly(A) sites within the trypanosome PTU can be transcribed without resulting in 98 premature termination. Therefore, a novel signal or mechanism may be involved in allowing polycistronic 99 transcription and termination in kinetoplastids. Two chromatin factors, base J and histone H3 variant 100 (H3.V), have recently been shown to have an impact on Pol II termination in kinetoplastids. Base J is a .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 101 modified DNA base found in kinetoplastids where the glucose moiety, linked via oxygen to the thymine 102 base, resides in the major groove of DNA (reviewed in (19)). In T. brucei and Leishmania major, J and 103 H3.V are enriched at sites involved in Pol II termination (20-23). This includes sites within polycistronic 104 gene clusters where (premature) termination silences downstream genes. Loss of J or H3.V leads to 105 read-through transcription (21-26). At PTU internal termination sites this leads to increased expression of 106 the downstream genes. This epigenetic regulation of termination is thought to allow developmentally 107 regulated expression of specific transcriptionally silent genes. In T. brucei, this includes the expression of 108 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes involved in antigenic variation during bloodstream infections. It is currently unclear how these epigenetic marks are involved in Pol II termination, since very 110 little is understood regarding the mechanism of Pol II termination in kinetoplastids. Equally unclear is what 111 regulates the specific localization of these marks, including base J, in the genome. Base J is synthesized 112 in a two-step pathway in which a thymidine hydroxylase (TH), JBP1 or JBP2, hydroxylates thymidine 113 residues at specific positions in DNA to form hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) (27), followed by the transfer of 114 glucose to hmU by the glucosyltransferase, JGT (28, 29) (reviewed in (19, 30)). The TH enzymes, JBP1 115 and JBP2, contain a TH domain at the N-terminus (27, 31-34). JBP1 has a J-DNA binding domain in the 116 C-terminal half of the protein that is able to bind synthetic J-DNA substrates in vitro and bind chromatin in 117 a J-dependent manner in vivo (35-38). The ability of JBP1 to bind J-DNA is thought to play a role in J 118 propagation and maintenance. JBP2 does not bind the modified base directly, but is able to bind 119 chromatin in a base J independent manner, presumably via the C-terminal SWI2/SNF2 domain (31, 35). 120 The JGT lacks DNA sequence specificity, and can convert hmU to base J in vivo regardless of where it is 121 present (39-41). This and other analysis of J synthesis indicate that JBP1 and JBP2 are the key 122 regulatory enzymes of J synthesis. In this study, we identify a new J-binding protein (called JBP3) in kinetoplastids that is present in 124 a complex containing PP1, Wdr82 and a putative orthologue of PNUTS. To characterize the role of this 125 (PJW/PP1) complex in transcription termination, we investigated the consequence of mutants using RNAi 126 in T. brucei. Ablation of JBP3, Wdr82 or PNUTS in T. brucei causes read-through transcription at 127 termination sites. As we previously demonstrated following the removal of base J and H3.V, these defects 128 include transcription read-through at termination sites within Pol II transcribed gene arrays and the silent 129 Pol I transcribed VSG expression sites, leading to de-repression of genes involved in parasite .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 130 pathogenesis. Furthermore, ablation of JBP3, Wdr82 or PNUTS results in expression of genes upstream 131 of Pol II transcription start sites presumably representing a previously unappreciated role of termination of 132 antisense transcription from gene promoters in trypanosomes. Overall these findings provide a first look 133 at mechanisms involved in Pol II transcription termination in kinetoplastids and a direct link between base 134 J and termination. 136 Results Affinity purification and identification of JGT-associated proteins in Leishmania In this study, we chose to identify the proteins that co-purify with JBP1, JBP2 and JGT, in order to 139 understand the regulation of J-biosynthesis. Leishmania tarentolae was chosen as an experimental 140 system, because it provides an easily grown source of high densities of parasites that synthesize base J. 141 The proteins were cloned into the pSNSAP1 vector, carrying a C-terminal tag composed of a protein A 142 domain, the TEV protease cleavage site, and the streptavidin binding peptide (42). Purification of the 143 complexes was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Separation of the final eluate from the 144 JGT tagged cell line by SDS-PAGE and staining of the proteins by SYPRO Ruby, revealed a dominant 145 protein band of ~120 kDa, representing JGT-S and several co-purified protein bands ( Fig 1A) . As a 146 control, no specific proteins were identified from the purification from untagged wildtype cells. In contrast, 147 and unexpectedly, no co-purified proteins were identified from the JBP1-S or JBP2-S purification either by 148 SDS-PAGE or mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, we continued the analysis on the JGT purification. 149 Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the JGT-S purification revealed a total 150 of five unique proteins not present in the negative control purification (Table 1) . These proteins were 151 required to have at least two unique peptides and a Seaquest score of at least 100. As expected, JGT-S 152 was recovered in the eluate. However, four additional potential JGT associated proteins were discovered 153 with (hypothetical) molecular masses of 74, 42 and 29 kDa. One of these JGT-interacting proteins (42 154 kDa; LtaP15.0230) was protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which contains a PP1 catalytic domain (Fig 1B) . 155 The other 42-kDa protein (LtaP32.3990) contains three WD repeat domains and has been identified as a 156 homologue of Wdr82/Swd2 (human/yeast). The remaining two JGT interacting proteins had not been .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 previously characterized. We named the 74-kDa protein JBP3 (LtaP36.0380) because it has a domain 158 with homology to the base J DNA binding domain of JBP1 (Fig 1B and S1 ) and we demonstrate its ability 159 to bind J-DNA (see below). The 29-kDa JGT interacting protein was named PNUTS (LtaP33.1440) since 160 it contains a conserved RVxF PP1 interactive domain (Fig 1C and S2 Fig) within an apparent intrinsically 161 disordered region of the protein and is a part of a complex similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans 162 (where JBP3 may represent a functional homolog of Tox4). PP1 interactive proteins such as PNUTS are 163 highly disordered in their unbound state and fall in a group of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (4-6). 164 This intrinsic flexibility is important for the formation of extensive interactions with PP1 (6, 43, 44). A 165 bioinformatics analysis using the DISOPRED3 program (45, 46), which scores for the occurrence of 166 disorder-inducing amino acids, predicts a majority of TbPNUTS is disordered (S2 Fig). Similarly, the 167 Compositional profiler (47) shows PNUTS is enriched in major disorder-promoting residues and depleted 168 in major order-promoting residues. This inherent disorder may explain why TbPNUTS migrates slower in 169 SDS-PAGE than predicted (see S3A Fig). To confirm the complex, we subsequently performed tandem 170 affinity purifications with tagged JBP3 and Wdr82. Reciprocal purification of JBP3 and Wdr82 resulted in 171 the identification of JGT, PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 with a significant number of unique peptide hits 172 (Table 1 ). These data indicate that in Leishmania JGT associates with a protein complex composed of 173 PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans, shown to be involved in 174 transcription termination (Fig 1F) . While JBP3 may be a functional homologue of the human Tox4 DNA 175 binding protein (see below), JBP3 appears to be conserved only in the genus trypanosome. Based on this 176 similarity, we now refer to this complex as PJW/PP1 in Leishmania. 177 178 Fig 1. Identification of a novel phosphatase complex in Leishmania tarentolae. (A) Proteins 179 recovered from tandem affinity purification from wild-type L. tarentolae extracts (WT) and from cells 180 expressing the strep-tagged version of JGT, were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Sypro 181 Ruby. (B) Summary of the PJW/PP1 complex. The domain structure of each component in the complex is 182 schematically shown. JBD, J-DNA binding domain; RVxF motif, PP1 docking motif; PP1c, catalytic 183 domain of protein phosphatase 1; WD40, WD40 repeat. The number of amino acids in each component is 184 indicated. (C) Structure-based sequence alignment of the PNUTS, spinophilin PP1 and NIPP1 interactive 185 domains in humans is compared with LtPNUTS (residues 95-112) and TbPNUTS (residues 139-164), 213 models generated by the comparative modeling program I-TASSER (48, 49) were of high quality, with 214 TM-score value of 0.727. The sequence identity and similar domain composition to the JBD of JBP1 215 supported our contention that the LtaP36.0380 protein is a J-binding protein, subsequently named JBP3. We have previously developed a rapid isolation procedure for His-tagged recombinant JBP1 217 produced in E. coli and gel shift assays to characterize J-DNA binding activities (37, 38). We utilized a 218 similar approach to characterize JBP3 in vitro DNA binding activity. The recombinant JBP3 obtained, as 219 judged by its appearance in Coomassie-stained gels (Fig 1D) , was suitable for investigating the specific 220 interaction of JBP3 and J-modified DNA (J-DNA). To determine the ability of JBP3 to bind J-DNA, we 221 used the gel shift assay to investigate the binding of JBP3 to J-DNA duplex (VSG-1J) that has a single 222 centrally located J modification compared with the same duplex without any base J (VSG-T). The J-DNA 223 substrate was incubated with increasing amounts of JBP3 protein, and the complex was analyzed on 224 native gels. The results of the gel shift assay in Fig 1E, show that the amount of free J-DNA decreases 225 with increasing concentrations of JBP3, concomitant with formation of the JBP3/J-DNA complex. In 226 contrast, incubation of the unmodified DNA substrate with the highest concentration of JBP3 resulted in 227 no visible complex. Thus, JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. 228 229 Characterization of the putative phosphatase complex containing Wdr82, JBP3 230 and PNUTS in T. brucei To study the function of the PJW/PP1 complex in vivo, we switched to T. brucei due to the 232 benefits of forward and reverse genetics available in this system. However, while all other components 233 are easily identified (see Tables 1 and 2) , a PP1 homologue identified in the Leishmania PJW/PP1 234 complex is not present in the T. brucei genome (50, 51). To characterize the complex in T. brucei, and 235 identify the TbPP1 protein component, we used a TAP tagging approach with a PTP epitope tag (52) to 236 identify TbPNUTS-interacting proteins. We generated a clonal procyclic form (PF) T. brucei cell line 237 expressing a C-terminal PTP-tagged TbPNUTS protein from its endogenous locus. This cell line was 238 used for the TAP procedure. Briefly, a crude protein extract was first purified by IgG affinity 239 chromatography, and the TEV protease was used to cleave off the Protein A portion of the PTP tag. .

As shown in Fig   465 5A and B, the silent 8340 gene within a dSSR on chromosome 10 is transcribed upon the loss of 466 TbPNUTS. To see whether there is a correlation between the initiation of the antisense transcript with 467 sense mRNA coding strand TSS, we analyzed the 5'-end of the nascent antisense transcript at this dSSR 468 using RT-PCR (Fig 5C) . The significant drop of inability of a 5' primer to amplify the cDNA corresponding 469 to the nascent 'antisense' transcript indicates the 5' end of the PNUTS regulated transcript is adjacent to 470 the TSS for the sense transcript on the opposing strand. Using various 3' primers for generating cDNA, 471 antisense transcription is attenuated in uninduced cells as shown in the decline in cDNA with increasing 472 length of the transcript (Fig 5D) . In the absence of PNUTS the antisense transcription fails to terminate, 473 as seen in the maintained levels of cDNA for all primers tested in + Tet. The increasing effects of the loss 474 of PNUTS on level of transcript with increasing length of the transcript supports the idea of PNUTS 475 regulating early termination/elongation of the antisense transcript. Taken together the results suggest that 476 the PJW/PP1 complex (PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82) regulates premature termination of antisense 477 transcription from bi-directional TSS and silencing of gene expression in T. brucei. Another possibility is that increased transcription within dSSRs is due to transcription initiating 479 upstream of the divergent TSSs in the absence of PNUTS. To address this possibility, we examined 480 transcription at Head-to-Head (HT) boundaries of PTUs. HT sites are defined where transcription of one 481 PTU terminates and transcription of another PTU on the same DNA strand initiates. In contrast to TSSs at 482 dSSRs, HT sites contain a termination site for the upstream PTU, indicated by H3.V and H4.V, and a TSS 483 marked by individual peaks of histone variants, such as H2A.Z, and histone modifications (22, 66, 67). 484 Similar to the metaplot analyses of dSSRs and cSSRs, we detected accumulation of transcripts at HT 485 sites upon the ablation of PNUTS (Fig 4D) . At these non-divergent TSSs, the region upstream of the start 486 site produced more transcripts in the PNUTS mutant indicating readthrough transcription, as expected, or 487 possible initiating events further upstream. More interestingly, antisense transcripts are also increased at 488 HT sites. The lack of a divergent TSS at these sites, indicated by the presence of single peak of H2A.Z, 489 supports the conclusion that the antisense transcripts are the result of regulated bi-directional 490 transcription activity. .

" The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSVinfected cells. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV. .

NF-κB, mainly p65/p50, activation during SeV and RSV infections occurs through IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκBα and of the p65 subunit 18, 19 . The signaling cascade leading to AP-1 activation is more elusive, but ultimately results in the phosphorylation of the nuclear Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF-2) and c-Jun subunits by JNK and p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) 10,20,21 . The activation of these transcription factors promotes the transcription of early antiviral genes, type I/III IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 12, 22, 23 . In response to IFNs, hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced to limit virus replication through enhancement of virus detection and innate immune signaling, cytoskeleton remodelling, inhibition of protein translation, induction of apoptosis, amongst other antiviral functions 24-26 . These same PRRs have also been shown to activate IFN-independent cell death pathways, including apoptosis 8 .

" The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak
" Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.",The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against COVID-19
" BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be .The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. By February 27, 2020, there were 78630 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now surpassed 2747 people in China have lost their lives because of this virus.

" Commentary: Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of death in hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients, but the microbiologic etiology of these infections is frequently unknown. The limits of current diagnostics preclude targeted antimicrobial treatments, resulting in excess morbidity and mortality. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing may enable precision diagnosis of respiratory infections in hematopoietic cellular transplant patients by simultaneously detecting microbial pathogens, transcriptional biomarkers of the host response, and the pulmonary microbiome. This approach may facilitate targeted antimicrobial prescription and provide a new method for distinguishing infectious and non-infectious post-transplant respiratory illness. ABSTRACT RATIONALE: Current microbiologic diagnostics often fail to identify the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients (HCT), which precludes the implementation of targeted therapies. OBJECTIVES: To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we evaluated the utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to detect microbial pathogens in HCT patients with acute respiratory illnesses. METHODS: We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent BAL at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and simultaneously assess the host transcriptional response. Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays. MEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTS: mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing. Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis); findings were confirmed by independent PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Relative to patients without infection, patients with infection had increased expression of immunity related genes (p=0.022) and significantly lower diversity of their respiratory microbiome (p=0.017). Compared to conventional diagnostics, mNGS enhanced detection of pathogens in BAL fluid from HCT patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining unbiased microbial pathogen detection with assessment of host gene biomarkers of immune response may hold promise for enhancing the diagnosis of post-HCT respiratory infections.

" The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan 17 City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has 18 contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of 19 population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces 20 and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed 21 a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of 22 cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two 23 days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days 24 later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest 25 that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection 26 transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the 27 epidemic. 28","Population movement, city closure and spatial transmission of the 2019-nCoV 1 infection in China 2"
" While numerous studies have explored single-word naming, few have evaluated the behavioral and neural correlates of more naturalistic language, like connected speech, which we produce every day. Here, in a retrospective analysis of 120 participants at least six months following left hemisphere stroke, we evaluated the distribution of word errors (paraphasias) and associated brain damage during connected speech (picture description) and object naming. While paraphasias in connected speech and naming shared underlying neural substrates, analysis of the distribution of paraphasias suggested that lexicalsemantic load is likely reduced during connected speech. Using voxelwise lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), we demonstrated that verbal (real word: semantically related and unrelated) and sound (phonemic and neologistic) paraphasias during both connected speech and naming loaded onto the left hemisphere ventral and dorsal streams of language, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time using both connected speech and naming data, we localized semantically related paraphasias to more anterior left hemisphere temporal cortex and unrelated paraphasias to more posterior left temporal and temporoparietal cortex. The connected speech results, in particular, highlight a gradient of specificity as one translates visual recognition from left temporo-occipital cortex to posterior and subsequently anterior temporal cortex. The robustness of VLSM results for sound paraphasias derived during connected speech was notable, in that analyses performed on sound paraphasias from the connected speech task, and not the naming task, demonstrated significant results following removal of lesion volume variance and related apraxia of speech variance. Therefore, connected speech may be a particularly sensitive task on which to evaluate further lexical-phonological processing in the brain. The results presented here demonstrate the related, though different, distribution of paraphasias during connected speech, confirm that paraphasias arising in connected speech and single-word naming likely share neural origins, and endorse the need for continued evaluation of the neural substrates of connected speech processes.",Error patterns in connected speech Stark et al Neural organization of speech production: A lesion-based study of error patterns in connected speech

" In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread. together produce 95 percent of the U.S. pig crop. 5 Farms experiencing outbreaks have suffered 90 percent and higher losses of .

" confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. The mean age of the dead was 71.48 ± 12.42 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 ± 4.42 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver.

" Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or ""species"", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

" Bacterial biofilms represent an essential part of Earth's ecosystem that can cause multiple ecological, technological and health problems. The environmental resilience and sophisticated organization of biofilms are enabled by the extracellular matrix that creates a protective network of biomolecules around the bacterial community. Current anti-biofilm agents can interfere with extracellular matrix production but, being based on small molecules, are degraded by bacteria and rapidly diffuse away from biofilms. Both factors severely reduce their efficacy, while their toxicity to higher organisms create additional barriers to their practicality. In this paper we report on the ability of graphene quantum dots to effectively disperse mature Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, interfering with the self-assembly of amyloid fibers -a key structural component of the extracellular matrix. Mimicking peptide-binding biomolecules, graphene quantum dots form supramolecular complexes with phenol soluble modulins, the peptide monomers of amyloid fibers. Experimental and computational results show that graphene quantum dots efficiently dock near the N-terminus of the peptide and change the secondary structure of phenol soluble modulins, which disrupts their fibrillation and represents a novel strategy for mitigation of bacterial communities.",Anti-biofilm Activity of Graphene Quantum Dots via Self-Assembly with Bacterial Amyloid Proteins

" The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. 5 Methods: We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. 10 Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed cocirculation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities 15 through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV 20 may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion. author/funder.

" Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in infants. Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses. All rights reserved.

" To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 . We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. : Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital. Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type. Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse in-hospital outcomes as compared to women. : medRxiv preprint 0.508 Neutrophil count, ×10 9 /L 3.1 (2.1-5.2) 4.1 (2.0-6.9) 2.9 (2.5-3.4) 0.353 Lymphocyte count, ×10 9 /L 1.3 (0.7-1.9) 1.2 (0.7-2.0) 1.3 (0.9-1.6) 0 869 ≥1.0, No. (%) 30 (63.8) 15 (53.6) 15 (78.9) 0.076 Platelet count, ×10 9 /L 230.0 (157.0-302.5) 218.0 (151.3-320.8) 230.0 (164.0-304.0) 0.696 ＞300.0, No. (%) 14 (29.8) 8 (28.6) 6 (31.6) 0.825 Procalcitonin, ng/ml 0.06 (0.03-0.10) 0.08 (0.05-0.19) 0.04 (0.03-0.07) 0.002 increased (＞0.05), No. (%) 25 (53.2) 19 (67.9) 6 (31.6) 0.014 All rights reserved.

" Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae. In 2015, ZIKV triggered a large epidemic in Brazil and spread across Latin America. In November of that year, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV was isolated from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly, and recent studies in mice models revealed that ZIKV infection may cause brain defects by influencing brain cell developments. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which ZIKV alters neurophysiological development remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by translational repression. In order to gain insight into the possible role of ZIKV-mediated miRNA signaling dysfunction in brain-tissue development, we computationally predicted new miRNAs encoded by the ZIKV genome and their effective hybridization with transcripts from human genes previously shown to be involved in microcephalia. The results of these studies suggest a possible role of these miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with this disease. Besides, a new ZIKV miRNA was predicted in the 3'stem loop (3' SL) of the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ZIKV genome, suggesting the role of the 3'UTR of flaviviruses as a source of miRNAs. February 1 st , 2016 [8]. ZIKV was detected by electron microscopy and RT-qPCR in brains and amniotic fluid of microcephalic fetuses, strengthening the causal link between ZIKV and increased incidence of microcephaly [9, 10] . Furthermore, recent studies show that ZIKV can infect human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro, resulting in dysregulation of cell-cycle-related pathways and increased cell death [11] . The development of animal models permits to begin to understand the underlying pathology of ZIKV infection [12, 13] . Modeling ZIKV infection in mice revealed direct effects of ZIKV on neural precursor cells development, including proliferation, differentiation and cell death, which may link ZIKV with the development of microcephaly [14] .

" Germline variation at immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete reference sequences in these regions is problematic because of segmental duplications and somatically rearranged source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.",Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity
" Human infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is driven by 28 recurring dromedary-to-human spill-over events, leading decision-makers to consider dromedary 29 vaccination. Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, 30 but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed 31 to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published 32 literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary 33 populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative 34 syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries 35 supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian 36 Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection 37 measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further 38 investigation -particularly of dromedary movement -and inform vaccination strategy design. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 .

The dromedary population is highly heterogeneous and 68 spans a wide geographic area stretching from West Africa through to the Middle East and parts of 69 Asia. Knowing when and where dromedaries would need to be targeted, and the likely impact of 70 vaccination, is necessary before further consideration of dromedary vaccination in the wider 71 socioeconomic and cultural context. 72 Here, we systematically reviewed published studies that measured MERS-CoV antibody 73 seroprevalence in dromedaries and/or prevalence of viral RNA in dromedaries. Assuming assay 74 specificity and long-term presence of antibodies after infection, seroprevalence can be used to 75 estimate what proportion of a dromedary population has ever been infected with MERS-CoV. Broken 76 down by age class, this can tell us when most animals encounter the infection for the first time. 77 Additionally, although whole-virus isolation and culture is necessary to confirm whether the shedding .

" A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure. : bioRxiv preprint rise of liver enzymes, implying liver function damage in patients infected with MERS-CoV [9].

" Arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes dominate chromatin and are often phased by alignment to reference sites like active promoters. How the distances between nucleosomes (spacing), and between phasing sites and nucleosomes are determined remains unclear, and specifically, how ATP dependent chromatin remodelers impact these features. Here, we used genome-wide reconstitution to probe how Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP dependent remodelers generate phased arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes. We find that remodelers bear a functional element named the 'ruler' that determines spacing and phasing in a remodeler-specific way. We use structure-based mutagenesis to identify and tune the ruler element residing in the Nhp10 and Arp8 modules of the INO80 remodeler complex. Generally, we propose that a remodeler ruler regulates nucleosome sliding direction bias in response to (epi)genetic information. This finally conceptualizes how remodeler-mediated nucleosome dynamics determine stable steady-state nucleosome positioning relative to other nucleosomes, DNA bound factors, DNA ends and DNA sequence elements.",Ruler elements in chromatin remodelers set nucleosome array spacing and phasing
" Human gremlin-1 is a physiologically versatile signaling molecule that has been associated with several human diseases including cancer. The ability of gremlin-1 to induce fibrosis in organs and transduce angiogenesis makes it a target for cancer therapy. RNAi-based therapy has proven to be very efficient and specific in tumor growth inhibition. The efficacy and specificity of siRNA-mediated gene silencing depends on the designing approaches. Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5'-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3'), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5'-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3') and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5'-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3') were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing.

" BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.",Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection by Detection of Nucleocapsid Protein running title: Diagnosis of COVID-19 by N antigen detection

" Uveitis is a visually-debilitating disorder that affects up to 30% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). To identify genetic susceptibility loci for uveitis in JIA, we conducted a genome-wide association study comparing 192 JIA-associated uveitis cases with 330 JIA individuals without uveitis. Two cohorts of JIA patients underwent genotyping and quality control. We used an HLA-specific imputation panel to impute HLA-specific amino acids and HLA types, and identified the amino acid serine at position 11 (serine-11) in HLA-DRB1 as associated to increased risk of uveitis (OR = 2.60, p = 5.43 x 10 -10 ). The signal at serine-11 was female-specific (interaction of sex and serine-11, p = 0.0096). Serine-11 resides in the YST-motif (positions 10-12) in the peptide binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Quantitative binding affinity predictions revealed peptide-binding preferences that distinguish HLA-DRB1 allotypes with the YST-motif.

" Clavibacter is an agriculturally important genus comprising a single species, Clavibacter michiganensis, and multiple subspecies, including, C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis which causes Goss's wilt/blight of corn and accounts for high yield losses -listed among the five most significant diseases of corn in the United States of America. Our research objective was to develop a robust and rapid multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect C. michiganensis in general and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with enhanced reliability and accuracy by adding non-complementary AT sequences to the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to identify unique and conserved gene regions for primer and probe design. The unique genomic regions, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein CDS/ABC-transporter permease and MFS transporter were determined for specific detection of C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis, respectively. The AT-rich sequences at the 5' position of the primers enhanced the reaction efficiency and sensitivity of rapid qPCR cycling; the reliability, accuracy and high efficiency of the developed assay was confirmed after testing with 59 strains from inclusivity and exclusivity panels -no false positives or false negatives were detected. The assays were also validated through naturally and artificially infected corn plant samples; all samples were detected for C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis with 100% accuracy. The assay with 5' AT-rich sequences detected up to 10-and 100-fg of C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis genome targets, respectively. No adverse effect was observed when sensitivity assays were spiked with host genomic DNA. Addition of 5' AT rich sequences enhanced the qPCR reaction efficiency from 0.82 (M = -3.83) and 0.91 (M = -3.54) to 1.04 (with optimum slope value; M = -3.23) for both C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis, respectively; a increase of 10-fold sensitivity was also obtained with C. michiganensis primer set.

Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10 -2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.",Evolution and variation of 2019-novel coronavirus

" Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments, and these genes are of high values. Herein, we improved the widely used Z curve method by creating a λ -interval Z curve, which considered interval association information. With this method and recursive feature elimination technology, a computational model was developed to predict human gene essentiality. The 5-fold cross-validation test based on our benchmark dataset obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8814. For the rigorous jackknife test, the AUC score was 0.8854. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. However, previous classifiers in three eukaryotes can gave satisfactory prediction only combining sequence with other features. It is also demonstrated that although the information contributed by interval association is less than adjacent nucleotides, this information can still play an independent role. Integrating the interval information into adjacent ones can significantly improve our classifier's prediction capacity. We re-predicted the benchmark negative dataset by Pheg server (http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/Pheg), and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential. Among them, 21 were found to be homologues in mouse essential genes, indicating that at least a part of the 118 genes were indeed essential, however previous experiments overlooked them. As the first available server, Pheg could predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human. It is also hoped the λ -interval Z curve method could be effectively extended to classification issues of other DNA All rights reserved.

" The outbreak of novel coronavirus has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread -with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform agedependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.",Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices
" Members of the Nidovirales order have (+)RNA genomes amongst the largest in size in the RNA virus world. Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5'-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2'-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2'-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase. author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/639369 doi: bioRxiv preprint Up to recently, four viral families, Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae constituted the Nidovirales order. The Coronaviridae family was further divided in two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Torovirinae family contained two genus Torovirus and Bafinivirus, plus few unassigned species. Recently, the ICTV proposed a novel classification into the Nidovirales order, with the creation of nine families [1] . In this novel ICTV proposal, ratified on February 2019, Coronaviridae do not encompass both Coronavirinae and Toronavirinae subfamilies. Rather, the new suborder Tornidovirinae (including toroviruses and bafiniviruses) contains a novel family, Tobaniviridae, at the same level as the Coronaviridae, which is now within suborder Cornidovirineae. This new taxonomy is used here, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Nidovirales have attracted much attention in the past decades for being causative agents of serious diseases in humans and animals. In humans, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) have been associated with high fatality/case ratios of ∼10% and ∼35 %, respectively (reviewed in [2]). In animals, pathogens of significant economical and societal impact include Equine Arteritis virus (EAV, Alphaarterivirus equid) and Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRSSV 1-2, Betaarterivirus suid 1-2). Two salient features of these viruses are, amongst others, their complex and still obscure replication/transcription mechanism as well as their broad genome-size range. Genomes of Arteriviridae (12.7 -15.7 kb in length), Mesoniviridae (∼20 kb), Medioniviridae (20.2 -25 kb), Euroniviridae (∼24.5 kb), Roniviridae (∼26 kb) Tobaniviridae and Coronaviridae (∼27-32 kb), Abyssoviridae (35.9 kb), and Mononiviridae (41.1 kb) members, share a similar genomic organisation generating viral mRNAs from a fixed genomic location, the 'nest', which has inspired the family name (Nido : latin for 'nest') [3, 4] . Nidovirales genomic and mRNAs are presumably capped, although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these Nidovirales members. In Eukaryotes, the RNA cap structure is thought to be synthesized post-transcriptionally [5] . Most of (+)RNA viruses supposedly follow a conventional RNA capping pathway [6] in which nascent viral 5'-triphosphate genomic (or mRNAs) is thought to be processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway implies that the 5'-triphosphate RNA is hydrolyzed into 5'-diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase, a GMP residue (the « cap », coming from GTP) is next covalently transferred to the 5'-diphosphate RNA in the 5' to 5' orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7-guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2'-oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) by one or two RNA methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. The MTase uses S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and releases S-Adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). There is no high-resolution structural analysis available of Nidovirales RNA caps. The evidence for their presence comes from immunological detection in Torovirus genomic and mRNAs [7] , and co-migration analysis in low-resolution chromatographic techniques for MHV [8] and Simian Hemorragic fever virus [9] . In other instances, Nidovirales cap structures supposedly conform to the canonical eukaryotic RNA capping pathway because enzymes usually deemed necessary to perform RNA capping are present in cognate genomes (reviewed in [6]). Bioinformatic analyses have been used to detect signature-sequences typically associated with RNA capping/modifying enzymes i.e guanlylyltransferase (GTase), polymerase, helicase, nuclease, and methyltransferase (MTase). These signature-sequences have served in many instances to isolate corresponding enzymes endowed with the predicted activity. In Nidovirales, this approach has been pioneered for Coronavirus enzymes, yet author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (fMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a comparison with non-fMW. : medRxiv preprint points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Results A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 vs 7.5, P＜0.001), AIS (6.9 vs 5.3, P＜0.001), anxiety (4.9 vs 4.3, P＜0.001) and depression (4.1 vs 3.6, P=0.001), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (67.2% vs 47.7%, P＜0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%, P ＜0.001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6, P=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (70.3% vs 54.6%, P<0.001). Conclusion fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW.

" A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the ""conservative transitions"" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias. .

" 25 Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated 26 with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the 27 nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural 28 areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which 29 allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and 30 demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers' 31 behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on 32 the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, 33 we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of 34 honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of 35 precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the 36 expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin 37 (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and 38 behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels 39 in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and 40 nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen 41 ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and 42 susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong 43 negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes 44 associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms 45 by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral 46 infections. 48 Approximately 35-40% of the world's crop production comes from plant species that depend on 49 animal pollination [1] which is carried out primarily by honey bees [2]. However, populations of 50 honey bees have experienced a severe decline during recent years worldwide [3, 4]. Possible 51 causes for colony losses have been proposed, including the effects of pesticides [5], nutritional 52 stress [6-8], the parasitic mite Varroa destructor [9, 10] and synergistic interactions between 53 Varroa and honey bee viruses [11]. However, none of these independent factors is consistently 54 associated with colony losses to suggest a single causal agent [3]. Thus, colony losses are likely 55 the result of the combination of several underlying factors [12, 13]. 56 57 There are several lines of evidence indicating that nutritional stress is an important contributing 58 factor for colony losses. First, there is a positive relationship between the area of uncultivated 59 forage land surrounding an apiary and annual colony survival [6, 8] suggesting that habitat loss 60 play a significant role in honeybee colony losses. Second, at individual levels, honey bees from 61 colonies kept in areas of high cultivation exhibited decreased levels of physiological biomarkers 62 associated with nutrition compared with bees kept in areas of low cultivation [7, 14], 63 demonstrating that availability of floral resources affects the nutritional state of honey bees. 64 65 Habitat loss associated with increased use of monocultures reduces both the quality (diversity of 66 plant sources) and the quantity of the pollen collected by the bees [15]. Simultaneous flowering in 67 monocultures provide pollen for a restricted period, and hives surrounded by monocultures 68 presumably experience pollen dearth before and after this period. Pollen is the main source of 69 proteins and lipids for honey bees [16, 17] and pollen from different plants differ in amino acid 70 content [18, 19] and fatty acids [20]. Thus, the consumption of pollen from diverse plant sources 71 increases the probability of obtaining the set of nutritional components (e.g., essential amino 4 72 acids and fatty acids) required for balanced nutrition. 73 74 Plasticity is a key feature of honey bee behavioral development [21], which is important for 75 understanding the consequences of nutritional stress on colony health and fitness. In the honey 76 bee, as in other eusocial insects, behavioral division of labor in workers is initially age-dependent 77 [21, 22]. Under typical spring and summer conditions in temperate climates, honey bee lifespan is 78 approximately one month. During the first two to three weeks of adult life, workers perform tasks 79 in the hive such as brood care (""nursing""); while in the last one to two weeks of life, workers 80 forage for food outside the colony [23, 24]. However, honey bee behavioral development is 81 flexible and can be accelerated or delayed according to colony demography and as an adaptive 82 response to different challenges [21]. In particular, the timing of nurse to forager transition is 83 normally accelerated in response to diverse types of stressors, including diseases [25] and 84 malnutrition [26]. 85 86 Interactions among key elements of the extended insulin/insulin-like growth signaling/target of 87 rapamycin (IIS/TOR) pathway including vitellogenin (Vg), juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin-88 like peptides (ILPs), regulate important physiological processes in honey bees, including 89 behavioral division of labor [27-31]. Vg is a yolk protein highly expressed in the fat bodies [29], 90 secreted into the hemolymph and then imported by developing oocytes [32]. JH, one of the major 91 insect hormones, is synthesized in the corpora allata in a final reaction catabolized by the enzyme 92 methyl farnesoate epoxidase (MFE) [33]. There are two genes encoding insulin genes (ilp1 and 93 ilp2) in the honey bee genome [34], which are expressed in several tissues and organs including 94 the brain and fat bodies [27, 29, 30]. In workers, negative interactions among vg with JH and 95 insulin like peptides are associated with task performance: while vg levels are higher in nurses 96 compared with foragers [29, 35-37], JH titers [21, 36, 38, 39] brain ilp1 and fat body ilp2 mRNA 5 97 levels follow an opposite pattern [27, 29, 30]. Experimental manipulations showed that these 98 correlations reveal causative positive and negative interactions among these three regulatory 99 elements. Thus, JH treatments inhibit vg expression [35, 40], but induce higher brain ilp1 levels 100 [29] and precocious foraging [21, 41]. Consistently, experimental reduction of vg by RNA 101 interference also result in higher levels of JH [27] and precocious foraging [28]. 102 103 In recent years, the proposal that nutrition is an important factor regulating the division of labor 104 among social insects has received increased support [26, 30, 42-46]. Pollen consumption is low in 105 young bees, largest in about 9-day-old nurses and then declines to minimal amounts in foragers 106 [47], which rely primarily on honey intake. Cage experiments showed that 6-day-old workers 107 eating pollen and sugar have higher abdominal vg and low brain ilp1 levels, while same-age bees 108 fed with only sugar had the inverse pattern [30]; resembling the expression profiles observed in 109 colony-reared nurses and foragers, respectively [29]. The effect of pollen on behavioral 110 development could result from its protein content. In support of this view, it has been shown that 111 increased levels of hemolymph amino acids, induced by protein injection, resulted in high vg 112 mRNA levels and delayed foraging [27]. Additionally, lipid metabolism also has been involved 113 in nutritional regulation of division of labor. Lipid content closely correlates with task 114 performance, being higher in nurses compared to foragers [43]. Feeding of an inhibitor of fatty 115 acid synthesis (TOFA) induced precocious foraging [48], further supporting a role of lipids on 116 the regulation of division of labor. However, it remains to be tested whether supplementary lipids 117 (e.g., essential fatty acids) have an effect on the nutritional regulation of this process. 118 119 Since genes that regulate behavioral division of labor are nutritionally regulated, they could be 120 expected to be ideal biomarkers of both nutritional and behavioral state in cage as well as colony-121 level studies. Progressive evidence is revealing that behavioral and nutritional states influence 6 122 honey bee immunity and susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, the use of reliable markers for these 123 traits can also facilitate effective disease diagnosis. Indeed, the initial use of vg as a predictive 124 marker of colony losses [49] and colony nutritional state [14] provides a promising starting point 125 toward this direction. 126 127 Although insects lack an acquired immunity, they have developed an efficient innate immune 128 system against a broad variety of pathogens [50]. Innate immunity has been traditionally divided 129 into humoral and cellular responses, but there are complex interactions and no clearly defined 130 boundaries between both types of immune responses [51]. Four main gene pathways mediate 131 insect innate immunity: Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK/ STAT, which include elements implicated in 132 both the humoral and cellular immune responses and belong to gene families involved in 133 signaling, pathogen recognition and effector functions [52, 53]. 134 135 Humoral immune responses are mainly associated with antimicrobial effectors belonging to the 136 Toll pathway such as abaecin [54], defensin1 (def1) [55] and hymenoptaecin (hym) [56]. On the 137 other hand, cellular immunity is mediated by haemocytes and involves responses including 138 phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation [57] While phagocytosis is mediated by pathogen 139 recognition proteins (e.g., peptidoglycan recognition proteins L and S) [58] and transmembrane 140 proteins such as eater [59], nodulation and encapsulation are often accompanied by melanization, 141 a process catalyzed by the pro-phenoloxidase (PPO) and pro-phenoloxidase activator (PPOact) 142 enzymes [52, 60, 61]. 143 144 Different studies have revealed interactions among nutrition, immunity and physiological changes 145 associated with behavioral development. First, nutrition affects the expression of immune genes 146 [62-64] and susceptibility to different pathogens [65-68]. Second, infections of pathogens and 8 171 almost 3X higher when compared with P-UR colonies (100 and 35, respectively; P= <0.0001). 172 Analysis of nectar and pollen foragers in each nutritional group showed higher numbers of both 173 types of foragers in P-R compared with P-UR colonies (nectar: P-R=53, P-UR-24, P= <0.0001; 174 pollen: P-R=47, P-UR=11, P= <0.0001). While no significant differences were found between the 175 number of nectar and pollen foragers in P-R colonies (P=0.52), the difference between both types 176 of foragers in P-UR colonies was highly significant (P=0.0027) with a lower number of new 177 pollen foragers than nectar foragers under this condition ( Figure 1A and Figures S2 and S3 ). 178 179 2. Brood production. 180 Two days after the end of the behavioral observations, and one day after the last collection of 3-181 week-old workers, newly-emerged bees were counted on frames from P-R and P-UR colonies 182 until the last bees emerged after 16 days. The cumulative number of newly-emerged bees from P-183 R colonies was significantly lower compared to P-UR colonies (2573 and 3881, respectively. 184 P=0.014) (Figure 1B). 185 186 Figure 1. Effects of pollen restriction on foraging and brood production. Values were pooled 187 from eight pollen restricted (P-R) and eight pollen un-restricted colonies (P-U). The upper panel 188 (A) shows the effect of nutrition on the average number of new foragers per day. The y-axis 189 indicates the number of nectar foragers, pollen foragers and total foragers observed per day (sum 190 of 3 periods of 15 min each). Nutritional groups plotted in the x-axis are as follow: pollen-191 restricted colonies (R), pollen-unrestricted colonies (UR). The lower panel (B) compares the total 192 number of bees born (y-axis) from colonies in both nutritional conditions (x-axis). Error bars 193 represent SE across colonies. Significant differences in the total number of foragers between R 194 and UR colonies are represented with black stars. Differences in pollen or nectar foragers 195 between nutritional conditions are represented with blue stars. 196 197 198 199 200 9 201 3. Behavioral, nutritional and age analyses of gene expression and virus titers 202 Genes associated with physiological activity 203 204 Vg expression was significantly affected by behavior, with higher levels in nurses in all 205 nutritional and age groups (P= <0.0001 for all behavioral comparisons). Expression levels in 206 nurses were on average 3.75X higher compared with foragers. (Figure 2A) . Nutritional 207 treatments also had a significant effect on vg expression, with higher levels in nurses from 208 colonies with unrestricted access to pollen (P-UR) compared with nurses from colonies with 209 restricted access to pollen (P-R) in both age groups (2-week-old: P= <0.0001; 3-week-old: 210 P=0.0075). Foragers also showed higher levels of vg in P-UR colonies compared with P-R 211 colonies, but only at the younger group (P=0.0003). Lastly, age comparisons showed a 212 significant increase in 3-week-old workers in all the nutritional and behavioral comparisons with 213 the exception of foragers from P-UR colonies (Figure 2A and Table S2 ). 215 Mrjp1 expression levels were strongly affected by behavior with higher levels in nurses compared 216 with foragers in all the nutritional and age comparisons. On average, mrjp1 levels in nurses were 217 5X higher compared with foragers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons showed that pollen 218 consumption induced a significant increase of mrjp1 in younger nurses (P=0.009) and foragers 219 (7.2e-6) compared with workers from P-R colonies. No nutritional differences were observed in 220 older 3-week-old workers. Age comparisons showed a tendency toward higher levels in older 221 foragers, which become significant in all the comparisons with the exception of foragers from P-222 UR colonies. It is interesting to note, that our whole-body analyses reveal that mrjp1 mRNA 223 levels were substantially higher compared with vg, being on average over 500X higher ( Figure   224 2A). 225 10 226 Mfe expression showed behaviorally related changes in 2-week-old workers, with higher levels in 227 nurses compared with foragers (P-R= 0.015, P-UR=0.016). In contrast, no significant behavioral 228 differences were observed in 3-week-old workers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons 229 showed significantly higher mfe expression associated with pollen intake exclusively in 3-week-230 old workers (nurses: P=0.035, foragers: P=0.014). Lastly, age comparisons revealed a trend 231 toward down-regulation of mfe expression in older workers. However, significant differences 232 were only found in foragers from P-R colonies (P=0.002). ( Figure 2B ). 234 The expression of ilp1 revealed complex interactions in our behavioral and nutritional analyses. 235 The behavioral analysis showed significantly higher levels in younger foragers from P-UR 236 colonies (P=0.033) and in older nurses from P-R colonies (P=0.034). On the other hand, 237 nutritional comparisons exhibited higher levels in 2-week-old foragers from P-UR colonies and 238 3-week-old nurses from P-R colonies (2-week-old: nurses P=0.61, foragers P=0.014; 3-week-old 239 nurses P=0.01, foragers P=0.30). In contrast with behavior and nutritional analyses, age 240 comparisons revealed a significant down-regulation in the expression of ilp1 in most of the 241 nutritional and behavioral groups of older workers (P-R nurses: P=0.058, P-R foragers: P= 242 <0.0001, P-UR nurses: P= 0.0001, P-UR foragers: P= 0.0005) ( Figure 2B ). 244 Expression of ilp2 showed behavioral differences only in younger workers, with higher levels in 245 foragers both from P-R (P=0.0001) and P-UR (P=0.006) colonies. Nutritional comparisons 246 showed a trend toward higher ilp2 levels with pollen consumption in 2-week-old workers, but the 247 differences were marginally significant (P-R=0.08, P-UR=0.08) (Table S2 ). In contrast, higher 248 expression of ilp2 was associated with pollen restriction in both 3-week-old nurses (P=0.0001) 249 and foragers (P=0.037). Age comparisons revealed higher ilp2 expression in workers from 250 colonies experiencing pollen restriction (nurses P= <0.0001, foragers P=0.001).

" The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO. Thousands of human infections have been diagnosed in China along with many other countries, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs. Although previous clinical studies have not observed vertical transmission of SARS-COV-2 among limited cases, this phenomenon still needs to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.",TITLE PAGE The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs by single cell transcriptome study
" Introduction. Bacterial infection is the leading cause of death in children globally. Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods: We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion. LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies. Correspondence: ccasals@clinic.cat",Lipocalin-2 is a Sensitive and Specific Marker of Bacterial Infection in Children

" Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to study samples composed of mixtures of organisms, such as in clinical applications where the presence of a pathogen at very low abundance may be highly important. We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.",SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors
" Untargeted accurate strain-level classification of a priori unidentified organisms using tandem mass spectrometry is a challenging task. Reference databases often lack taxonomic depth, limiting peptide assignments to the species level. However, the extension with detailed strain information increases runtime and decreases statistical power. In addition, larger databases contain a higher number of similar proteomes. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow to address the increasing search space required for MS/MS-based strain-level classification of samples with unknown taxonomic origin. TaxIt first applies reference sequence data for initial identification of species candidates, followed by automated acquisition of relevant strain sequences for low level classification. Furthermore, proteome similarities resulting in ambiguous taxonomic assignments are addressed with an abundance weighting strategy to improve candidate confidence. We apply our iterative workflow on several samples of bacterial and viral origin. In comparison to noniterative approaches using unique peptides or advanced abundance correction, TaxIt identifies microbial strains correctly in all examples presented (with one tie), thereby demonstrating the potential for untargeted and deeper taxonomic classification. TaxIt makes extensive use of public, unrestricted and continuously growing sequence resources such as the NCBI databases and is available under open-source license at https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics.",TaxIt: An iterative and automated computational pipeline for untargeted strain-level identification using MS/MS spectra from pathogenic samples
" Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are responsible for over 4 million deaths per year worldwide with pathobiont carriage a required precursor to infection. Through a crosssectional community-based nasal self-swabbing study we sought to determine carriage epidemiology for respiratory pathogens amongst bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis) and viruses (RSV, Influenza viruses A and B, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Coronavirus, Parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and Adenovirus (ADV)). Carriage of bacterial and viral species was shown to vary with participant age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. The spatial structure of microbial respiratory communities was less nested (more disordered) in the young (0-4 years) and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X 2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed for samples collected in the summer and from older individuals (those aged 5-17, 18-64 and ≥ 65 years) but not in samples collected from winter, younger individuals (those aged 0-4 years), individuals with recent RTI and individuals without recent RTI, demonstrating the importance of both neutral and niche processes in respiratory community assembly. The application of epidemiological methods and ecological theory to sets of respiratory tract samples has yielded novel insights into the factors that drive microbial community composition, such as seasonality and age, as well as species patterns and interactions within the nose.","Epidemiological and ecological modelling reveal diversity in upper respiratory tract microbial population structures from a cross-sectional community swabbing study Key words Ecology, Epidemiology, Respiratory Infection Running Title Application of epidemiological and ecological modelling to microbial populations Corresponding Author"

" Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of 25 the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, 26 on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus 27 infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then 28 developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit 29 models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting 30 robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral 31 propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular 32 morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections 33 within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely 34 cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that 35 diverge from those unique to bats. 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 .

In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this 66 IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or 67 DNA (Zhou et al. 2016). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit 68 widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats 69","Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence 1"

Many of these RBPs localize several mRNAs and may have additional direct interaction partners to regulate their functions. Using immunoprecipitation from whole Drosophila ovaries coupled to mass spectrometry, we examined protein-protein associations of 6 GFP-tagged RBPs expressed at physiological levels. Analysis of the interaction network and further validation in human cells allowed us to identify 26 previously unknown associations, besides recovering several well characterized interactions. We identified interactions between RBPs and several splicing factors, providing links between nuclear and cytoplasmic events of mRNA regulation. Additionally, components of the translational and RNA decay machineries were selectively co-purified with some baits, suggesting a mechanism for how RBPs may regulate maternal transcripts. Given the evolutionary conservation of the studied RBPs, the interaction network presented here provides the foundation for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization across metazoans. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 5 consistent with the role of their mammalian homologs (38, 50-52). During early oogenesis, both Vas and Nos are involved in the maintenance of germline stem cells, in oocyte differentiation and other aspects of oocyte development (26, 35, 53-56). In embryos, Nos functions in germline development (53, 57-61) and further promotes the inclusion of germline cells in the developing ovary (53, 62). In addition to oogenic processes, Nos and Stau are also involved in the development of the Drosophila nervous system (63, 64). Many RBPs in Drosophila oogenesis have overlapping functions that are likely differentially regulated. Little is known about this regulation and it may involve several as yet unidentified mRNP components. To comprehensively identify RBP interactors, we carried out a systematic in vivo purification screen of GFPtagged RBPs coupled with mass spectrometry. We employed both labeled and label-free MS methods and identified several proteins significantly enriched with the purified RBPs. The interactomes of the individual RBPs were largely independent with some overlap. Our screen identified several previously unknown interactions, many of which we validated in vitro. This work presents an extended interaction network of RBPs in Drosophila, offering a new reference point for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization. Experimental procedures Cloning and DNA constructs For cloning purposes, total RNA was extracted from wild-type ovaries using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in the presence of oligo (dT)15 primers. To express proteins in human HEK293 cells, genes of interest were amplified from Drosophila cDNA, or in some cases from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC) clones, using the standard PCR conditions. Accession numbers of all the genes cloned are provided in Table S1. Fragments were cloned into mammalian expression vectors based on pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), bearing an N-terminal EGFP tag or modified to contain either HA or HA-Flag tags (provided by Elisa Izaurralde, MPI Tübingen). Full-length cDNAs were cloned, except for protein Nucampholin (Ncm), where a sequence encoding amino acids 359-664 was amplified. The boundaries were designed based on the MIF4G domain of the human ortholog CWC22, which has been shown to bind eIF4AIII (65). To serve as a control, either MBP or EGFP alone was used. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 6 Drosophila stocks All flies were kept at room temperature on standard Drosophila medium. Oregon R flies were used as wildtype. Fosmid lines expressing GFP-tagged proteins were purchased from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC 318283, 318719, 318195, 318157, 318898, 318766), as previously published (66). To generate the control fly line expressing the tag only, the tag sequence was cloned in a modified pUAST-attB vector (67) (without UAS sites or SV40 poly(A) signal), downstream of a moderately expressing exu promoter using KpnI and BamHI sites. The purified vector was injected into embryos from a recombinant stock with a genotype y[1] M{vas-int.Dm} ZH-2A w[*]; PBac{y[+]-attP-3B}VK00033 (BDSC 24871). Transgenic flies were identified in the F1 generation by the presence of red eyes (dsRed) and a stable fly line was established. Cell culture and co-IP from HEK cells Human HEK293 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, Glutamine and Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, at 37 ºC in the presence of 5% CO2. For co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP), transfections were carried out in six-well plates with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 5 μg of DNA was transfected in each well and the ratio of two plasmids was adjusted based on their expression levels. If required, a third empty plasmid with HA tag was supplemented, to reach a total amount of 5 μg. Cells were collected 2 days after transfection and washed with PBS prior to lysis. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 at 4 ºC, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM Sucrose, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete™, EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). For efficient lysis, cells were mechanically sheared by passing them through a needle (Sterican 21G 7/8"" Ø 0.8X22mm) several times.

" The epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus in Wuhan at the end of 2019 has become an urgent public event of worldwide concern. However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic. improvement of medical conditions, and rich experience in treatment, patients with COVID-19 will be treated more effectively. Consequently, the CR will increase, and the CFR will decrease. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",Estimating the cure rate and case fatality rate of the ongoing epidemic COVID-19

" However, prevalence data are scarce in migrant populations. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of S. stercoralis at hospital level in migrant populations or long term travellers being attended in out-patient and in-patient units as part of a systematic screening implemented in 6 Spanish hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted and systematic screening for S. stercoralis infection using serological tests was offered to all eligible participants. The overall seroprevalence of S. stercoralis was 9.04% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 7.76 -10.31). The seroprevalence of people with a risk of infection acquired in Africa and Latin America was 9.35% (95%CI 7.01-11.69), 9.22% (7.5-10.93), respectively. The number of individuals coming from Asian countries was significantly smaller and the overall prevalence in these countries was 2.9% (95%CI -0.3; -6.2). There was only one case (1/14 (7.14%) from an individual from East European countries. The seroprevalence in units attending potentially immunosuppressed patients was significantly lower (5.64%) compared with the seroprevalence in other units of the hospital (10.20%) or Tropical diseases units (13.33%) (p<0.001). Conclusions: We report a hospital-based systematic screening of strongyloidiasis with a seroprevalence of almost 10% in a mobile population coming from endemic areas suggesting the need of implementing strongyloidiasis screening in hospitalized patients coming from endemic areas, particularly if they are at risk of immunosuppression. Strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis which is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas. In the rest of the countries, it is also frequent in migrants coming from tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is more severe when an infected subject has an impaired immune system. Within this study we have evaluated the prevalence of this infection in people being attended in six Spanish hospitals. The prevalence was around 9%, being higher in Africa and Latin America compared with other regions. In addition, the prevalence in patients with an impaired immune system (immunosuppression) was lower compared with people non suffering immunosuppression. These results suggest that the prevalence of strongyloidiasis is quite high among migrants living in Spain and that a screening programme should be designed, particularly in immunosuppressed patients that are at more risk of suffering severe complications of the infection.",TITLE: HIGH PREVALENCE OF STRONGYLOIDIASIS IN SPAIN: A HOSPITAL-BASED STUDY
" Corona virus disease 2019 has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing You'an Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥ 20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1×10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury.

" Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic 26 fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California 27 serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often 28 asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals 29 have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential 30 antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral 31 molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that 32 exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, 33 was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in 34 multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or 35 infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a 36 known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that 37 the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift 38 Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), 39 and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant 40 reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of 41 potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus 42 replication. 43 44 Importance 45 No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen 46 compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses 47 with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against 48 La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. 49 We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium 50 ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that 51 valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus 52 as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has 53 activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion 54 homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.",Novel ionophores active against La Crosse virus identified through rapid 1 antiviral screening 2 3
" The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a timevarying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 -February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential interprovince routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.",How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China?

" One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability. Here we compared the development of HIV-1 28 resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) between wild-type (WT) virus and a synthetic 29 virus (MAX) carrying a codon-pair re-engineered protease sequence including 38 (13%) 30 synonymous mutations. WT and MAX viruses showed indistinguishable replication in 31 MT-4 cells or PBMCs. Both viruses were subjected to serial passages in MT-4 cells 32 with selective pressure from the PIs atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). After 32 33 successive passages, both the WT and MAX viruses developed phenotypic resistance to 34 PIs (IC 50 14.6 ± 5.3 and 21.2 ± 9 nM for ATV, and 5. 9 ± 1.0 and 9.3 ± 1.9 for DRV, 35 respectively). Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus. Our results 43 indicate that HIV-1 protease position in sequence space delineates the evolution of its 44 mutant spectra. Nevertheless, the investigated synonymously recoded variant showed 45 mutational robustness and evolvability similar to the WT virus. 46 47 IMPORTANCE 48 Large-scale synonymous recoding of virus genomes is a new tool for exploring various 49 aspects of virus biology.

" Cancer gene therapy is a great promising tool for cancer therapeutics due to the specific targeting based on the cancerous gene expression background. Binary systems based on sitespecific recombination are one of the most effective potential approaches for cancer gene therapy. In these systems, a cancer specific promoter expresses a site-specific recombinase/integrase that in turn controls the expression of a toxin gene. In the current study, we have developed a new HK022 bacteriophage Integrase (Int) based binary system activating a Diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression specifically in cancer cells. We have demonstrated the efficiency, and the high specificity of the system in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in a lung cancer mouse model. Strikingly, different apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors demonstrated a remarkable efficacy killing capability of the Int-based binary system compared to the conventional hTERT-DTA mono system in the LLC-Kat lung cancer mice model; we observed that the active hTERT promoter down regulation by the transcription factors Mad-1 is the cornerstone of this phenomenon. The new Int-based binary system offers advantages over already known counterparts and may therefore be developed into a safer and efficient cancer treatment technology.",An anti-cancer binary system activated by bacteriophage HK022 Integrase
" Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.",Vulnerabilities in coronavirus glycan shields despite extensive glycosylation
" Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8 + T cell count, CD4 + T cell count, and so on.

" Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease 7 control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen 8 is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively 9 to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing 10 natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the 11 influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple 12 a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain 13 with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective 14 behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of 15 the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane 16 analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against 17 them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour 18 enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain 19 has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing 20 the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our 21 results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour 22 in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts 23 to control infectious diseases. 24 1 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/293936 doi: bioRxiv preprint 25 Modern approaches to developing a theory of the spread of infectious diseases can be traced to 1927 when 26 Kermack and McKendrick developed an integro-differential equation model now widely described as the SIR 27 (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model [1]. The model tracks changes in the number of individuals suscep-28 tible to an infection S(t), the number of infected individuals I(t), and (implicitly) the number of recovered 29 individuals R(t). Compartmental models such as the SIR model are useful for mechanistic modelling of 30 infection transmission in populations. They have since been further developed to study the evolution and 31 epidemiology of multiple species of pathogens in a population or different strains of the same species [2]. Some models focus on between-host competition while some others on within-host competition [3] . Bull 33 suggested in the 1990s that coupling inter-host and intra-host dynamics in models may be desirable [4] . Models linking between-host transmission dynamics to within-host pathogen growth and immune response 35 are now becoming commonplace [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]. One such approach is to link host viral load (which is a 36 necessary condition of virulence) to the between-host transmission rate. Compartmental models have also been used to study the phenomenon of pathogen virulence-the rate 38 at which a pathogen induces host mortality and/or reduces host fecundity [9, 10, 11, 12]. It was initially 39 believed that hosts and parasites co-evolved to a state of commensalism (whereby parasites benefit from 40 their host without harming them) [13, 14] but this hypothesis was later challenged [15]. In mathematical 41 models, virulence is often treated as a fixed model parameter expressing the excess mortality rate caused 42 by the pathogen. For instance, virulence has been assumed to depend on the intrinsic reproductive rate 43 of the parasite [16]. Other research expresses the transmission rate β and the recovery rate µ in terms 44 of a parameter ν that represents virulence [17]. When the impact of human behaviour is discussed in 45 such models, it is discussed in terms of hypothesized effects of human behaviour on the value of the fixed 46 parameter representing virulence. A Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virulence model by Massad et 47 al [18] shows that reducing the number of sexual partners could possibly drive HIV to be a more benign 48 pathogen. However, the model assumes that the number of sexual partners can simply be moved up or down 49 as a model parameter, whereas in reality the number of sexual partners in a population is the outcome of 50 a dynamic socio-epidemiological process that merits its own mechanistic modelling, and itself responds to 51 pathogen virulence. In general, these models do not treat human behaviour as a dynamic variable that can 52 evolve in response to transmission dynamics and influence the evolution of virulence. (A few exceptions 53 exist, including work that allows virulence to be a function of the number of infected hosts, thus capturing a 54 situation where the magnitude of the epidemics affects the ability of health care services to host patients [19].) 55 However, as human responses to both endemic and emerging infectious diseases show, human behaviour can 56 2 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/293936 doi: bioRxiv preprint have a significant influence on how infections get transmitted. For instance, an early and well-documented 57 example shows how the residents of the village of Eyam, England quarantined themselves to prevent the 58 spread of plague to neighbouring villages [20]. Individuals moved to less populated areas during the Spanish 59 Influenza pandemic in the early 20th century [21]. More recently, masks became widely used during the 60 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the 21st century [22], and 61 it has been shown pathogen virulence in Marek's disease can evolve in response to how vaccines are used 62 [23]. Theoretical models of the interactions between human behaviour and the spread of infectious diseases 64 are increasingly studied [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. For instance, Bagnoli et al [31] found that under 65 certain conditions, a disease can be driven extinct by reducing the fraction of the infected neighbours of an 66 individual. Zanette et al [32] showed that if susceptible individuals decide to break their links with infected 67 agents and reconnect at a later time, then the infection is suppressed. Gross [33] also shows that rewiring of 68 edges in a network (and thus social interaction) can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Of 69 the compartmental models, we focus on those that have used concepts from evolutionary game theory such 70 as imitation dynamics [34] to describe the evolution of behaviour and its interplay with the epidemics. An 71 example of imitation dynamics concerns, as described in detail in [35], the effect of vaccination on the spread 72 of infectious diseases. Each individual in the population picks one strategy and adopts it: ""to vaccinate"" or 73 ""not to vaccinate"". The proportion of vaccinators is modelled using an ordinary differential equation and 74 is coupled with a standard SIR model. An important aspect of behavioural models is to couple them with 75 epidemiological processes such as transmission. This coupling creates a feedback loop between behaviour 76 and spread of the disease. 77 Given that adaptive social behaviour is important in many aspects of infection transmission, we hy-78 pothesize that adaptive social behaviour can also influence selection between pathogen strains with differing 79 virulence in ways that cannot be captured by assuming it to be represented by a fixed parameter. Our 80 objective in this paper was to explore how behaviour and virulence influence one another, in a coupled 81 behaviour-disease differential equation model. The model allows individuals who perceive an increase in 82 the prevalence of infection to increase their usage of practices that reduce transmission rates (such as social 83 distancing and hand-washing) and thereby boost population-level immunity. This approach can help us 84 understand the effects specific social dimensions, such as level of concern for a strain or the rate of social 85 learning, on the coupled dynamics of pathogen strain emergence and human behaviour in a situation where 86 virulence imposes evolutionary trade-offs and is strain-specific. Instead of considering long-term evolutionary 87 processes with repeated rounds of mutation and selection, we focus on the case of invasion of a single mutant 88 strain with a large phenotypical difference compared to the resident strain. In the next section, we describe 89 3 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

All variables represent 102 the number of individuals with the given infection status (for instance, S is the number of susceptible 103 individuals). Since R does not appear in the other equations, we can omit R from the analysis. The system of differential equations in the presence of adaptive human behaviour couples the SI 1 I 2 R 105 epidemic spread with a differential equation for human behaviour (""coupled model""). Each individual in the 106 population can choose to accept or reject behaviours that reduce infection risk (e.g. washing hands, wearing 107 a mask, social distancing), and individuals imitate successful strategies observed in others. Let x represent 108 the proportion of individuals accepting preventive behaviour (we will call these ""protectors""). Individuals 109 sample others in the population at rate κ, representing social learning. The choice is based on the perceived 110 severity ω 1 (resp. ω 2 ) from the resident (resp. mutant) strain, where ω 1 (resp. ω 2 ) can be quantified as the 111 probability that an infection by the resident (resp. mutant) strain results in a severe case of disease.

Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed during the cell-intrinsic immune response to viral infection. IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5' end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and subsequent 40S recruitment. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal 'YxxxL' motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement.

" Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein). ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B 0 AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B 0 AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2.

" Generation intervals, defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when 14 that individual infects another person, link two key quantities that describe an epidemic: 15 the reproductive number, R, and the rate of exponential growth, r. Generation intervals 16 are often measured through contact tracing by identifying who infected whom. We study 17 how observed intervals differ from ""intrinsic"" intervals that could be estimated by tracing 18 individual-level infectiousness, and identify both spatial and temporal effects, including cen-19 soring (due to observation time), and the effects of susceptible depletion at various spatial 20 scales. Early in an epidemic, we expect the variation in the observed generation intervals to 21 be mainly driven by the censoring and the population structure near the source of disease 22 spread; therefore, we predict that correcting observed intervals for the effect of temporal 23 censoring but not for spatial effects will provide a spatially informed ""effective"" generation-24 interval distribution, which will correctly link r and R. We develop and test statistical 25 methods for temporal corrections of generation intervals, and confirm our prediction using 26 individual-based simulations on an empirical network. An epidemic can be characterized by the exponential growth rate, r, and the reproductive 32 number, R. The reproductive number, defined as the average number of secondary cases 33 arising from a primary case, is of particular interest as it provides information about the 34 final size of an epidemic (1; 2). However, estimating the reproductive number directly from 35 disease natural history requires detailed knowledge which is not often available, particularly 36 early in an outbreak (3). Instead, the reproductive number can be indirectly estimated from 37 the exponential growth rate, which can be estimated from incidence data (4; 5; 6; 7; 8). These two quantities are linked by generation-interval distributions (9; 10; 11; 12; 13). 39 A generation interval is defined as the time between when a person becomes infected and 40 when that person infects another person (10). Due to individual variation in infection time, 41 the observed generation-interval distribution can change depending on when and how it is 42 measured (10; 14; 15; 16). There are important distinctions to be made when estimating 43 generation intervals: intrinsic generation intervals measure the infectiousness of an infected 44 individual, while observed generation intervals refer to the time between actual infection 45 events. 46 While the intrinsic generation-interval distribution is often assumed to be fixed, the 47 shape of the observed generation-interval distribution depends on when and how intervals 48 are measured (14; 15; 17; 16; 18). When an epidemic is growing exponentially, as often occurs 49 near the beginning of an outbreak, the number of newly infected individuals will be large 50 relative to the number infected earlier on. A susceptible individual is thus relatively more 51 likely to be infected by a newly infected individual. Thus, ""backward"" generation intervals 52 (which look at a cohort of individuals, and ask when their infectors were infected) will be 53 shorter on average than intrinsic generation intervals -the converse is true when an epidemic 54 is subsiding (15; 16; 18). In practice, generation intervals are often measured by aggregating available information 56 from contact tracing. While an epidemic is ongoing, these measurements are ""censored"": we 57 don't know what happens after the observation time. These censored intervals are similar 58 to backward intervals: there is a bias towards observing shorter intervals, which are more 59 likely to have concluded by the observation time. Realized generation intervals are also affected by spatial structure. In a population 61 that does not mix homogeneously, susceptibility will tend to decrease more quickly in the 62 neighbourhood of infected individuals than in the general population. This means that 63 contacts made late in an individual's infection are more likely to be ineffective due to contacts 64 that were made earlier (because the contactee may have been infected already) As a result, 65 realized generation intervals will have shorter mean than the intrinsic generation-interval 66 distribution. This perspective allows us to reinterpret the finding of (19) that, given an 67 intrinsic generation interval and an observed growth rate, the reproductive number on various 68 network structures is always smaller on a network than would be predicted from homogeneous 69 mixing. These observations allow us to make the following prediction: removing the time-70 censoring bias from observed generation intervals will yield a spatially corrected ""effective"" 71 distribution that contains information about the population structure and will allow us to 72 2",Inferring generation-interval distributions from contact-tracing 2 data
" The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings.

In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

" Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.","Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak"
" Recombination is a process that unlinks neighbouring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology. We use the Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection (GARD) method (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) , as implemented in the software package HyPhy (Pond et al., 2005) , to look for alternative tree topologies in sequence data.

" The introduction of electronic patient records in the ambulance service provides new opportunities to monitor the population. Most patients presenting to British ambulance services are discharged at scene. Ambulance records are therefore an ideal data source for syndromic early event detection systems to monitor infectious disease in the prehospital population. It has been previously found that tympanic temperature records can be used to detect influenza outbreaks in emergency departments. This study investigated whether routine tympanic temperature readings collected by ambulance crews can be used to detect seasonal influenza. Here we show that these temperature readings do allow the detection of seasonal influenza before methods applied to conventional data sources. The counts of pyretic patients were used to calculate a sliding case ratio (CR) as a measurement to detect seasonal influenza outbreaks. This method does not rely on conventional thresholds and can be adapted to the data. The data collected correlated with seasonal influenza. The 2016/17 outbreak was detected with high specificity and sensitivity, up to 9 weeks before other surveillance programs. An unanticipated outbreak of E. coli was detected in the same dataset. Our results show that ambulance records can be a useful data source for biosurveillance systems. Two outbreaks caused by different infectious agents have been successfully detected. The routine ambulance records allowed to use tympanic temperature readings that can be used as surveillance tool for febrile diseases. Therefore, this method is a valuable addition to the current surveillance tools.","A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM BASED ON ROUTINE AMBULANCE RECORDS IN THE SOUTH-WEST OF ENGLAND, FOR THE INFLUENZA SEASON A PREPRINT"
" Coronavirus disease broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and soon after Chinese health authorities took unprecedented prevention and control measures to curb the spreading of the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia. We develop a mathematical model based on daily updates of reported cases to study the evolution of the epidemic. With the model, on 95% confidence level, we estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 = 2.82 ± 0.11, time between March 19 and March 21 when the effective reproduction number becoming less than one, the epidemic ending after April 2 and the total number of confirmed cases approaching 14408 ± 429 on the Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province.",A deterministic epidemic model for the emergence of COVID-19 in China
" Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R . Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts"
" Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on the surface of virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with a rise in the pH of the Golgi lumen. We demonstrate that infection with IBV induces neutralization of Golgi luminal pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cells factors, protecting IBV spike protein (S) from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells.",The Infectious Bronchitis Virus Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH to Protect Spike Protein and Promote Release of Infectious Virus
" One sentence summary: Disruptions of school and work due to heavy snowfall in the Seattle metro area reduced the total size of respiratory virus epidemics by up to 9%. BACKGROUND: Unusually high snowfall in western Washington State in February 2019 led to widespread school and workplace closures. We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%.

" In eukaryotes, the degradation of cellular mRNAs is accomplished by Xrn1p and 24 the cytoplasmic exosome. Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, 25 they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack 26 sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA 27 degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. One model is that the RNA of yeast 28 viruses is subject to degradation simply as a side effect of the intrinsic exonuclease 29 activity of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Contrary to this model, we find a highly 30 refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the ""L-A"" totiviruses of different 31 Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under 32 positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p 33 protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that 34 these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where 35 Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically 36 infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-37 A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii.

" word count: 247 12 Text word count: 5,657 Abstract 15 Influenza viruses and rhinoviruses are responsible for a large number of acute respiratory 16 viral infections in human populations and are detected as co-pathogens within hosts. Clinical and 17 epidemiological studies suggest that co-infection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce 18 disease severity and that they may also interfere with each other's spread within a host population. To determine how co-infection by these two unrelated respiratory viruses affects pathogenesis, 20 we established a mouse model using a minor serogroup rhinovirus (RV1B) and mouse-adapted 21 influenza A virus (PR8). Infection of mice with RV1B two days before PR8 reduced 22 pathogenesis of mild to moderate, but not severe PR8 infections. Disease attenuation was 23 associated with an early inflammatory response in the lungs and enhanced clearance of PR8. However, co-infection by RV1B did not reduce PR8 viral loads early in infection or inhibit 25 replication of PR8 within respiratory epithelia or in vitro.

" The authors find that human cells re-entering the cell cycle from quiescence have both an impaired p53-dependent DNA replication origin licensing checkpoint and slow origin licensing. This combination makes every first S phase underlicensed and hypersensitive to replication stress. To maintain tissue homeostasis, cells transition between cell cycle quiescence and proliferation. An essential G1 process is Minichromosome Maintenance complex (MCM) loading at DNA replication origins to prepare for S phase, known as origin licensing. A p53-dependent origin licensing checkpoint normally ensures sufficient MCM loading prior to S phase entry. We used quantitative flow cytometry and live cell imaging to compare MCM loading during the long first G1 upon cell cycle entry and the shorter G1 phases in the second and subsequent cycles. We discovered that despite the longer G1 phase, the first G1 after cell cycle re-entry is significantly underlicensed. As a result, the first S phase cells are hypersensitive to replication stress. This underlicensing is from a combination of slow MCM loading with a severely compromised origin licensing checkpoint. The hypersensitivity to replication stress increases over repeated rounds of quiescence. Thus, underlicensing after cell cycle re-entry from quiescence distinguishes a higher risk cell cycle that promotes genome instability.",Intrinsic checkpoint deficiency during cell cycle re-entry from quiescence Condensed title: Underlicensing at cell cycle re-entry
" We utilized a cell-level approach to examine glycolytic pathways in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia (n=16) and control (n=16) subjects and found decreased mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes. To replicate these novel bioenergetic findings, we probed independent datasets for bioenergetic targets and found similar abnormalities. Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of ""reversing"" the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases.",Connectivity analyses of bioenergetic changes in schizophrenia: Identification of novel treatments Running title: Bioenergetic function in schizophrenia
" The bacterial bipartite transferrin receptor is an iron acquisition system that is required for 12 survival by several key human and animal pathogens. It consists of the TonB-dependent 13 transporter Transferrin binding protein A (TbpA) and the surface lipoprotein Transferrin binding 14 protein B (TbpB). Curiously, the Tbps are only found in host specific pathogens, and are 15 themselves host specific, meaning that they will bind to the transferrin of their host species, but 16 not to those of other animal species. While this phenomenon has long been established, neither 17 the steps in the evolutionary process that led to this exquisite adaptation for the host, nor the 18 steps that could alter it, are known. We sought to gain insight into these processes by studying 19 Tbp specificity in Histophilus somni, a major pathogen of cattle. A past study showed that whole 20 cells of H. somni specifically bind bovine transferrin, but not transferrin from sheep and goats, 21 two bovids whose transferrins share 93% amino acid sequence identity with bovine transferrin. 22 To our surprise, we found that H. somni can use sheep and goat transferrins as iron sources for 23 growth, and that HsTbpB, but not HsTbpA, has detectable affinity for sheep and goat 24 transferrins. Furthermore, a third transferrin binding protein, HsTbpA2, also showed affinity for 25 sheep and goat transferrins. Our results show that H. somni TbpB and TbpA2 act to broaden the 26 host transferrin recognition range of H. somni. 27",Transferrin binding protein B and Transferrin binding protein A 2 expand the transferrin 1 recognition range of Histophilus somni 2 3 Running title: TbpB and TbpA2 broaden specificity of
" Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

" The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients (16.09%) and 4 cases among 33 (12.12%)staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side.

Sia come in 21 a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the 22 C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these 23 acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms 24 are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these 25 modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl 26 modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and 27 canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they 28 were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. 29 The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell 30 lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene 31 (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using 32 CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O-and 9-O-acetyl Sia 33 expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and 34 knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no 35 change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these 36 modifications.

" Lectins are glycan-binding proteins with no catalytic activity and ubiquitously expressed in nature. Numerous bacteria employ lectins to efficiently bind to epithelia, thus facilitating tissue colonisation. Wounded skin is one of the preferred niches for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has developed diverse strategies to impair tissue repair processes and promote infection. Here, we analyse the effect of the P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes and demonstrate that it triggers events in the host, upon binding to fucosylated residues on cell membrane receptors, that extend beyond its role as an adhesion molecule. We found that LecB associates with several growth factor receptors and dampens their signalling pathways, leading to the arrest of cell cycle. Additionally, we describe a novel LecB-triggered mechanism to downregulate host cell receptors by showing that LecB leads to insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 internalisation, without receptor activation, and subsequent missorting towards intracellular endosomal compartments. Overall, these data highlight that LecB is a multitask virulence factor that, through subversion of several host pathways, has a profound impact on keratinocyte proliferation and survival.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB impairs keratinocyte fitness by abrogating growth factor signalling
" Adenoviruses are double-strained DNA viruses found in a great number of vertebrates, 8 including humans. In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a 9 human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are 10 important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across 13 species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses 15 across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could 16 hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of Adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian 19 species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, 20 males were more likely to be infected by Adenoviruses than females, due to the 21 immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend 22 4 29 Author Summary 30 Adenoviruses are DNA viruses with a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, 31 causing ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we focus on the prevalence of 32 Adenoviruses in bats, which are known to be natural reservoir of many viruses, using the results 33 of recent screenings for prevalence of these viruses in 33 European bat species. Our aim is to 34 find association between Adenoviruses prevalence and biological and behavioral host traits, 35 considering the heterogeneity both between and within species in order to have a deeper 36 understanding of mechanisms of viral transmission. Our results highlight the importance of mating strategy: bats species using swarming as mating 38 strategy are less likely to be infected by Adenoviruses. Moreover, we found that locality of 39 capture can explain a higher prevalence of Adenovirus within species. However, no general 40 pattern has been found in the analysis at individual level, suggesting a strong species specificity 41 and complex viral transmission dynamics. 42 43",Mating strategy is determinant of Adenovirus prevalence in European bats 2
" As of Feb 16th 2020, 2019-nCoV has infected more than 51,857 people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

" Hand hygiene is considered as an efficient and cost-effective way to limit the spread of diseases and, as such, it is recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.

The H1N1 flu, which caused around 300,000 deaths worldwide 7 , had a similar timeline. The first confirmed case of H1N1 was reported in Veracruz, Mexico on April 2009, while within few days the infection migrated to the US and Europe, and two months later the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared the disease as a global pandemic. Bacteria, pathogens and viruses are also transmitted easily at airports or during flights, causing infections and bacterial diseases that can expand to global epidemics. The pathogens are transmitted through the air 8 , resulting in the contagion of airborne diseases, or through physical contact between individuals. The transmission is accelerated when a dense population of people is concentrated in a confined area 9 like an airport, with lack of good hygiene and efficient air ventilation. After an outbreak, infections diffuse while infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals. Airports play a major role in such contagious dynamics 10 , as they contribute daily to the contact of people from all over the world, some of whom may be carrying endemic infections and bacteria from their country of origin. In addition, there are numerous highly contaminated surfaces which are frequently touched by the passengers at airports and inside aircrafts 11 . Self-service check-in screens, gate bench armrests, water fountain buttons and door handles at airports, as well as seats, tray tables and handles of lavatories in aircrafts, are all known to have high microbial contamination 12-14 . Mitigation strategies are designed and implemented to inhibit a global pandemic. At the individual level there is a focus on behavioral change towards adopting different interventions in the case of a health emergency 15, 16 . Along with other developments in medicine, vaccination has made a big contribution in that direction leading to the extinction of past epidemics and a significant reduction of mortality due to specific infections 17 . Vaccination has a substantial mitigating effect when effective vaccines are available soon enough after the emergence of a new disease and when vaccination campaigns cover about 70% of a susceptible population 18 . However, despite the known impact of vaccines on the reduction of infections, the rate of vaccination in the population has remained unchanged over the past decade 19 . Social nudges such as peer effects or education on vaccination benefits, and changes in the design of vaccination campaigns, can be deployed to change human behavior towards the increase of influenza vaccination rates 20 . In addition of preventing disease spreading by vaccination, isolating patients at home or closure of high-risk places like schools can moderate the transmission of disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms. Several actions within the world air transportation network can be implemented to control a disease spreading in the case of a health emergency 21 . At the global scale, mobility-driven interventions such as airport closures and deliberate rerouting of the travelers, can reduce the number of individuals passing through or traveling from/to regions where dangerous diseases prevail 22 . At the local scale, actions at individual airports such as frequent cleaning of public areas (e.g. toilets, gates, check-in desks, etc.), efficient air ventilation and enhanced sensitization of frequently touched surfaces can reduce the risk of contamination and the transmission of infections. Furthermore, personal hygiene is the most important factor to prevent the spread of an infection 23 . Coughing etiquette, face masks, no face touch and hand hygiene are the most common actions that air travelers can easily adopt. From those actions, hand washing is the simplest and most effective component for preventing the transmission of viruses 24-27 and bacteria, and is regularly mentioned as the first recommendation of precautions in health care (see for example 28 ). A scientific study on the effects of hand washing on the bacterial contamination of hands, showed that after a deliberate contamination of individuals by touching door handles and railings in public places, bacteria were found in 44% of the sample, while this percentage was reduced to 23% after hand washing with water only, and to 8% after hand washing with water and plain soap 29 . The same study concluded also that the effect of hand washing does not depend on the bacteria species. While hand hygiene is considered as the first prevention step in the case of an epidemic emergency, there is lack of evidence for its effects as a mitigation strategy against global epidemic spreading. In this work, we study contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and we elucidate the impact of hand-hygiene behavioral changes on the diffusion of infections worldwide. We develop a computational model to track the realistic mobility patterns of air travelers, their hand washing behavior and the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Human mobility is modelled by a stochastic agent-base system that accounts for the spatial distribution of airports, the realistic human mobility through the world air transportation network, and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at origin, destination and connecting airports. In addition, we develop a compartmental epidemic model which relates the disease spreading with hand-hygiene behaviour. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we assess the impact of hand washing at the early stages of a global epidemic spreading. From the simulation results, we measure the early-time spreading power of the 40 busiest airports under four different intervention scenarios: 1. increase of hand washing engagement homogeneously at all airports; 2. increase of hand washing engagement only at the source of the disease; 3. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports of the world air transportation network; and 4. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports for each source of the disease. The aim of this study is to identify the most effective mitigation strategy of hand hygiene contributing the most to the reduction of global epidemic spreading.",Hand-hygiene mitigation strategies against global disease spreading through the air transportation network

CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a ABSTRACT Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES), regardless of symptoms, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for pathogens with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection, as such infections may contribute to onward transmission and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome. However, estimating VES is resource-intensive. We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VES when limited information is available and resources are constrained. We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.",Title: Analyzing Vaccine Trials in Epidemics with Mild and Asymptomatic Infection
" Background: Viral encephalitis is a dangerous compromise between the need to robustly clear pathogen from the brain and the need to protect neurons from bystander injury. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae. We previously identified brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear. Methods: Chemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry. CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2. Results: Inoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 hours postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response. Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint. Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection. Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain. Conclusions: We conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.",Neuronal CCL2 expression drives inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain during acute virus infection

The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein 21 actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 22 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The 23 caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the 24 chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. 25 In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early 26 and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. 27 Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and 28 Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase 29 secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the 30 inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without 31 affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation 32 assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC 33 in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in 34 DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and 35 golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was 36 also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in 37 mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The 38 association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of 39 secreted hexameric NS1. 40 41 AUTHOR SUMMARY .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/370932 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3 42 Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted 43 NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional 44 secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 45 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex , a complex formed by caveolin-1 and 46 several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the 47 expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished 48 the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the 49 chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, 50 increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was 51 found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus 52 infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is 53 released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin 54 complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the 55 importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route 56 may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment. 57 58 59 4 64 infection and its public health burden are hard to estimate, but at least 100 countries are currently 65 endemic for dengue [2]. DENV has a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The 66 genome of DENV is translated into a single polyprotein and encodes for three structural (C, E, 67 prM/M) and seven non-structural (NS) (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) proteins. 68 The polyprotein is then cleaved by host and viral proteases to release individual viral proteins 69 [3]. The viral genome replication process within the host cell is mainly driven by the NS proteins. 70 The NS1 protein act as an scaffolding protein that anchors the replication complex to the ER 71 membrane and interacts physically with NS4B [4]. The NS1 protein is a 352-amino-acid 72 polypeptide with a molecular weight of 46-55 kDa, depending on its glycosylation status. The 73 NS1 protein exists in multiple oligomeric forms and is found in different cellular locations: a cell 74 membrane-bound form in association with virus-induced intracellular vesicular compartments, 75 on the cell surface and as a soluble secreted hexameric lipoparticle [4]. The NS1 monomeric 76 form rapidly dimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), then three dimeric forms of NS1 77 arrange to form an hexamer [5]. The hexameric form of NS1 shows an open barrel form filled 78 with lipids and cholesterol which resemble the lipid composition of the HDL particle [6]. 79 Recent studies have shown that the DENV NS1 protein was not only secreted from vertebrate 80 cells, but that was also efficiently secreted from mosquito cells lines [7,8]. The secretion of NS1 81 in vertebrate cells follows the classical Golgi-pathway [9]. However, NS1 secretion in infected 82 mosquito cells is associated to a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent pathway and was found to be 83 Brefeldin A (BFA)-insensitive, suggesting a traffic route that bypasses the Golgi-complex [10]. 84 Caveolae are made up of interlocking heteropolymers of a family of small proteins (caveolins: 1-85 3) and a second family of accessory structural proteins (flotillins and three family of cavins). The 86 caveolar architecture is connected with unstructured cavin filaments by coiled-coil domains into .

This complex is believed to provide scaffolding for compartmented 88 cellular processes and participates in multiple cellular functions, including endocytosis, 89 transcytosis, membrane homeostasis, inflammation, and signal transduction [11]. Caveolin 1 90 (Cav-1), a 21-24-kDa scaffolding protein, is not only a key structural component of the caveolae 91 organelle but also plays an important in the transport of free-cholesterol inside the cell [12,13]. 92 The chaperone caveolin complex (CCC) is a cytosolic complex reported to transport cholesterol 93 synthetized de novo from the ER to cell membranes or other compartments within the cell. CCC 94 has been described as a complex of CAV-1, Cyclophilin A (CyA), FK506-binding protein 4 or 95 heat shock protein 56 (FKBP52), and Cyclophilin 40 or D (Cy40) [12,14]. Cyclophilin A (CyA), 96 an 18 kDa peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, is a ubiquitous and multifunctional protein. In 97 addition to its role as a host-cell receptor for cyclosporine A, CyA has diverse functions in 98 inflammatory conditions and diseases [15,16]. The 52-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP52) an 99 immunophilin belonging to the FKBP family, is a known co-chaperone of the heat shock protein 100 90 (HSP90) and thus may play a role in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of 101 the steroid hormone receptors [17,18]. Cyclophilin 40 (Cy40), a member of a family of highly 102 homologous peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), is known to play a role in 103 mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), being an integral constituent of the MPT pore [19]. 104 Given the CAV-1 dependent secretion of NS1 protein in mosquito cells and the lipoprotein nature 105 of the released hexameric form of NS1, it was found plausible to study the association of NS1 106 traffic to the novo cholesterol transport in DENV infected mosquito cells. In this work, data is 107 presented indicating that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 enters the unconventional 108 secretory pathway very early after maturation in the ER and usurps the cholesterol transport 109 between the ER and the plasma membrane, mediated by the CCC, to reach the extracellular .

In addition, data is presented suggesting that a similar pathway is used for the secretion 111 of Zika Virus NS1 protein in infected mosquito cells. 112 113 RESULTS 114 NS1 secretion is not affected by drugs that disrupt early steps of the classical secretion 115 pathway 116 Golgicide A (GCA) is a powerful inhibitor of the COPI vehicle transport from ER to Golgi [20]. 117 Thus, the cytotoxicity of GCA in the mosquito cell lines (C6/36, Aag2) and the vertebrate cell line 118 BHK-21, used for comparisons, was measured using the reduction of tetrazolium salts to 119 examine proliferation in cells treated with serial dilutions of GCA. No significant cytotoxicity was 120 observed under 30 M of GCA in any of the three cell types (Fig 1A) . Fli-06 is a novel drug which 121 inhibits the diffusion of ER synthetized proteins to the ER-exit sites [21,22]. Fli-06 cytotoxicity 122 was determined in C6/36 and Aag2 cells also using also tetrazolium salt reduction. No significant 123 cytotoxicity was observed under 100 M of Fli-06 in the mosquito cells lines (Fig 1B) . Thus, 124 concentration of 27 M and 100 M were used for GCA and Fli-06, respectively, since these 125 concentrations proved non-toxic, yet effective in causing Golgi disruption (Fig 1C) . Figures 1D   126 and 1E show that the GCA-treatment of DENV infected C6/36 and Aag2 cells did not cause any 127 change in NS1 secretion. In contrast, NS1 secretion was reduced over 70% in infected BHK-21 128 cell treated either with GCA or BFA ( Fig 1F) . As expected, virion release was reduced in 129 mosquito and vertebrate cells after GCA or BFA treatment (Fig 1G, 1H and 1I ). To further explore 130 the traffic route of NS1 in DENV infected mosquito cells, cells were also treated with Fli-06. 131 Treatment of infected C6/36 or Aag2 cells with non-toxic concentrations of Fli-06 shows no effect .

Experiments with Fli-133 06 were not carried out in BHK-21 due to high drug toxicity. The results with GCA and Fli-06 134 indicate NS1 is not secreted by a classical secretory pathway and that newly synthetized DENV 135 NS1 do not reach the ER-exit sites and leaves the ER compartment very early after synthesis. 136 Since the release of mature virions, which are multimolecular complexes, may not be equivalent 137 to the release of a single protein, an additional control for protein trafficking through the classical 138 secretory pathway was included. To this aim, a vector, pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo, constitutively 139 expressing Gaussia Luciferase in C6/36 cell was constructed (S1 Fig). To evaluate the effect of 140 GCA treatment on GLuc secretion, cells were treated with GCA for 24 h and the activity of GLuc 141 present in the cell supernatants analyzed using a luminescence assay. A decrease in luciferase 142 activity, in relation to the control (DMSO), was detected upon treatment of C6/36 with GCA, and 143 in BHK-21 cells transfected with ptk-GLuc vector, run in parallel as control (Fig.1J). These results 144 indicated that the luciferase reporter is secreted in both mosquito and vertebrate cells following 145 a classical secretory route and reinforce the results indicating that in mosquito cells DENV NS1 146 is secreted by an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi (Fig 1K). 147 148 NS1 secretion is dependent on the CCC 149 The CCC is formed by the association of CAV-1 with the chaperones CyA, FKBP52, Cy40 150 [12,13]. The CCC is responsible for cholesterol transport inside the cell. Previous data by us [10] 151 indicated that NS1 secretion was dependent on CAV-1. Thus, to fully evaluate the participation 152 of the CCC in DENV NS1 secretion from mosquito cells, CyA was pharmacologically inhibited 153 by treatment with Cyclosporin A (CsA) and the expression of the chaperones FKBP52 and Cy40 .

Previously, the non-cytotoxic concentration for CsA in mosquito 155 and vertebrate cells were determined (Fig 2A) . DENV2 or DENV4-infected C6/36 or Aag2 cells 156 were treated with 9 M CsA for 24 hours; NS1 secretion was reduced in about 30% and 40% in 157 C6/36 and Aag2 cells, respectively (Fig 2B, 2E) . However, virion release in the treated mosquito 158 cells was not significantly affected (Fig 2C and 2F ). In contrast, the inhibition of CyA in BHK-21 159 cells did not have any effect in either NS1 or virion secretion (Figs 2H and 2I). To further 160 corroborate the participation of CyA in cholesterol and lipid traffic, the lipid droplet count in CsA 161 treated versus untreated cells was determined. In all cases, C6/36, Aag2 and BHK-21 cells 162 treated with CsA showed a diminished amount of lipid droplets per cell as compared with un-163 treated cells (Fig 2D, 2G and 2J). 164 The expression of FKBP52 in C6/36 cells was knock down by siRNA transfection. Optimal gene 165 knock down was achieved after 48h post transfection (Fig 3A) . The effect of FKPB52 reduced 166 expression in cholesterol and lipid metabolism was evaluated measuring the lipid droplet 167 counting per cell and a reduction of about 50% in the number of lipid droplets was observed after 168 the treatment (Fig 3B) . In cells treated with siRNA FKBP52, a significant reduction in NS1 of 169 about 20% secretion was observed ( Fig 3C) . Viral release was not affected by FKBP52-knock 170 down (Fig 3D) . Given that FKBP52 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 [17,23], we wanted to discard if 171 the observed inhibitory effect on NS1 secretion might be related to a reduction in HSP90 activity. 172 Thus, the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) in NS1 release from DENV infected 173 C6/36 cells was tested. As shown in Figure 3E , NS1 secretion was not affected after GA 174 treatment. The expected reduction in virus yield observed in GA treated cell (Fig 3F) show that 175 effective GA doses were used. These results indicate that the effect in NS1 secretion observed 176 after FKBP52 silencing is not related with HSP90 activity and was rather associated with the",The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from mosquito 2 cells in association with the intracellular cholesterol transporter chaperone
 BACKGROUND: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children (≤5 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE. A total of 141 fecal samples of children ≤5 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were collected from rural Primary Health Care facilities in the Vhembe district of SA between June 2017 and July 2018. Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%). CONCLUSION: HBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis.,HUMAN BOCAVIRUS PREVALENCE IN CHILDREN WITH ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHEN REGION OF SOUTH AFRICA Running Head: Human Bocavirus in children with AGE
" An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of ""test-and-treat"" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.",Speed and strength of an epidemic intervention
" RNA viruses are capable of rapid host shifting, typically due to a point mutation that confers expanded host range. As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the dsRNA bacteriophage phi6 (wildtype and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens (PA). Sanger sequencing of fifty PA mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing both revealed the same high frequency mutations allowing infection of PA. Wildtype phi6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wildtype clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wildtype phi6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12 and two others had point mutations in p9 and p5 -none of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion. RNA viruses mutate rapidly and frequently expand their host ranges to infect novel hosts, leading to serial host shifts. Using an RNA bacteriophage model system (Pseudomonas phage phi6), we studied the impact of pre-existing host range mutations on another host range expansion. Results from both clonal Sanger and Illumina sequencing show extant host range mutations dramatically narrow the neighborhood of potential host range mutations compared to wildtype phi6. This research suggests that serial host shifting viruses may follow a small number of molecular paths to enter additional novel hosts. We also identified .

" Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 . A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039].

" Sialic acids (Sia) are the primary receptors for influenza viruses, and are widely displayed on cell surfaces and in secreted mucus. Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including α2-3 or α2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites.

" The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients.

" Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is an alphacoronavirus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pigs. A key determinant of viral tropism and entry, the PEDV spike protein is a key target for the host antibody response and a good candidate for a protein-based vaccine immunogen. We used electron microscopy to evaluate the PEDV spike structure, as well as pig polyclonal antibody responses to viral infection. The structure of the PEDV spike reveals a configuration similar to that of HuCoV-NL63. Several PEDV protein-protein interfaces are mediated by non-protein components including a glycan at Asn264 and two bound palmitoleic acid molecules. The polyclonal antibody response to PEDV infection shows a dominance of epitopes in the S1 region.

Expressions were allowed to proceed for five days. Cell supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 ´ g to remove cells followed by 12,000 ´ g to remove cell debris. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and then applied to a column of Streptactin superflow. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of Tris-buffered saline and then the protein was eluted with same buffer with 2 mM desthiobiotin. The eluted protein was purified by Superose6 Increase 10/300 gel filtration. Proteins were concentrated for structural studies using ultrafiltration (Sigma-Millipore, AmiconUltra 4 mL, 30K MWCO, Cat. #UFC903024). After 3-day acclimation, pigs in the challenged group were inoculated with a prototype US PEDV isolate US/Iowa/18984/ 2013 (GenBank accession #KF804028) (Hoang et al., 2013), 10 3 plaque-forming units/pig, via oro-gastric gavage as previously described (Madson et al., 2014). Pigs in the control group received virus-free cell culture media. Some of these pigs were inoculated again with the same strain in the identical manner at day 56 post-inoculation (PI).",Structure and immune recognition of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein
" + These first authors contributed equally to this article BACKGROUND As of February 29, 2020, nearly 80 thousand confirmed novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection cases had been reported in China. Risk factors for transmission remain largely uncharacterized. The reproduction of infection can be characterized in two major scenarios, i.e., within-households and between-households [1]. Within-household transmission provides important information of infections cross age groups and genders. Estimation of the within-household transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is particularly important for disease control to characterize whether household contact might be driving the outbreak. If it transpires that virus is prone to transmit to a particular age group or gender, then special measures can be taken to control the transmission [2]. This study describes the transmission of the virus within households and close contacts.",Title: Close contacts and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China: a content analysis based on local Heath Commissions' public disclosures
" Background Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognized as an important rodent-borne viral hemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2018, LF caused an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria, and the situation was worse in 2019. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of outbreaks in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and local rainfall by using modeling analysis. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz, and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (τ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and local rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated Rs for 2017-18 (1.33 with 95% CI: [1.29, 1.37]) and 2018-19 (1.29 with 95% CI: [1.27, 1.32]) are significantly higher than those for 2016-17 (1.23 with 95% CI: [1.22, 1.24]) . We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for outbreaks in different Nigerian regions. For the association between rainfall and R, we find that a one unit (mm) increase in .

" Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called 'quasispecies'. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis
" Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in humans. However, the impact of antibiotic 27 use on host cells is understudied. We have identified a novel antiviral effect of commonly 28 used aminoglycoside antibiotics. We show that mucosal application of aminoglycosides 29 increased host resistance to a broad range of viral infections including herpes simplex 30 viruses, influenza A virus and Zika virus. Aminoglycoside treatment also reduced viral 31 replication in primary human cells. This antiviral activity was independent of the microbiota 32 as aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice. Microarray analysis uncovered a 33 marked upregulation of transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following 34 aminoglycoside application. ISG induction was mediated by TLR3, and required TIR-35 domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), signaling adaptor, and interferon 36 regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, transcription factors that promote ISG expression. 37 XCR1+ dendritic cells, which uniquely express TLR3, were recruited to the vaginal mucosa 38 upon aminoglycoside treatment and were required for ISG induction. These results 39 highlight an unexpected ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to confer broad antiviral 40 resistance in vivo.",Microbiota-independent antiviral protection conferred by aminoglycoside antibiotics 1 2
" Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogenic virus that 24 causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages. Deoxynivalenol (DON), the 25 most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals 26 and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains 27 unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of 28 PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-29 seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, 30 receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 μg/kg DON, respectively. We 31 observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and 32 the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in 33 experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like 34 vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in 35 experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 36 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted 37 in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and 38 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced 39 occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs 40 post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM 41 DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. Specifically, 42 deletion of LC3B indicated a crucial role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Pretreatment with SB202190, a p38 signaling inhibitor, abolished the 44 induction of autophagy. Furthermore, downregulation of type I interferon revealed that 45 DON contributed PEDV to escape innate immune. Mechanistically, DON-caused 46 innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited 47 STING phosphorylation. Taken together, DON could promote PEDV infection by 48 inducing occludin internalization and innate immune escape via triggering p38-49 mediated autophagy. 50 Author summary 53 Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease, leads to catastrophic 54 economic loss to the global pig industry. Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED 55 virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor 56 of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We 57 guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig 58 intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the 59 present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell 60 line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, 61 morbidity and gut barrier.

" Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against : bioRxiv preprint 2 MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca 2+ ) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca 2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca 2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca 2+ . Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca 2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca 2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca 2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca 2+ , as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca 2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca 2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus. 3 dromedary camels [3] [4] [5] . It is currently believed that disease outbreaks in humans result from interactions with dromedary camels. Although transmissions between humans is rare, this route was responsible for a widespread outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015 in South Korea [6] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that MERS-like bat CoV could potentially infect human tissues in the absence of an intermediate host when the respective tissue expresses a protease that is able to prime the virus for fusion [7] . More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed MERS-CoV as one of ten diseases that requires urgent accelerated research and development because of its potential to cause a public health emergency with few or no efficacious drugs and/or vaccines to counter them [8] . To address these needs, it is important to have a more nuanced understanding of MERS-CoV infection process to develop therapeutics to target crucial steps in MERS-CoV infection. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein contains a receptor binding subunit (S1) and a membrane fusion subunit (S2), which facilitates binding to the host cell surface receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and fusion with the host cell membrane, respectively [10, 11] . To mediate fusion with the host cell membrane, S needs to be cleaved by either host cell surface proteases or endosomal proteases (such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, or cathepsins) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Cleavage can occur at two different sites: the S1 and S2 boundary (S1/S2), and adjacent to a fusion peptide (FP) within the S2 domain (S2') [17, 18] . It is suggested that both cleavage events act in concert to promote membrane fusion and viral infectivity. The first cleavage event takes place at the S1/S2 site, which then is believed to open up the S2' site for further proteolytic processing, resulting in the exposure of the FP. As a consequence, the FP inserts into the host membrane, mediating membrane fusion [19] . MERS-CoV viral fusion can occur at two different locations in the host cell: at the plasma membrane or at the endosomal membrane. Host cell surface proteases, such as TMPRSS2, can cleave MERS-CoV S for entry directly at the plasma membrane [13] . In the absence of cell surface proteases, MERS-CoV is endocytosed,",Ca 2+ ions promote fusion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus with host cells and increase infectivity
" Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a quarantine plant pathogen bacterium originating from the Americas 15 and that has emerged in Europe in 2013. Xf can be detected directly on plant macerate using 16 molecular methods such as real-time PCR, which is a sensitive technique. However, some 17 plants may contain components that can act as PCR reaction inhibitors, which can lead to false 18 negative results or an underestimation of the bacterial concentration present in the analyzed 19 plant sample. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an innovative tool based on the partitioning of 20 the PCR reagents and the DNA sample into thousands of droplets, allowing the quantification 21 of the absolute number of target DNA molecules present in a reaction mixture, or an increase 22 of the detection sensitivity. In this study, a real-time PCR protocol, already used for Xf detection 23 in the framework of official surveys in the European Union, was transferred and optimized for 24 Xf detection using ddPCR. This new assay was evaluated and compared to the initial real-time 25 PCR on five plant matrices artificially inoculated and on naturally infected plants. In our 26 conditions, this new ddPCR enabled the detection of Xf on all artificially inoculated plant 27 macerates with a similar limit of detection, or a slight benefit for Quercus ilex. Moreover, 28 ddPCR improved diagnostic sensitivity as it enabled detection of Xf in samples of Polygala 29 myrtifolia or Q. ilex that were categorized as negative or close to the limit of detection using 30 the real-time PCR. Here, we report for the first time a ddPCR assay for the detection of the 31 bacterium Xf. 32",Comparison of real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR for the detection of Xylella fastidiosa in plants
" Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a causative agent for poor pregnancy outcome and fetal developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly and eye defects. As a result, ZIKV is now a confirmed teratogen. Understanding host-pathogen interactions, specifically cellular perturbations caused by ZIKV, can provide novel therapeutic targets. In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Protein-lncRNA interaction maps revealed that MALAT1 and NEAT1 share common interacting partners and form a larger network comprising of 71 cellular factors. ZIKV-mediated dysregulation of these two regulatory lncRNAs can alter the expression of respective target genes and associated biological functions, an important one being cell division. In conclusion, this investigation is the first to provide insight into the biological connection of lncRNAs and ZIKV which can be further explored for developing antiviral therapy and understanding fetal developmental processes.",Dysregulation of Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Genes and Predicted lncRNA-protein Interactions during Zika Virus Infection
" China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.",
" doi: bioRxiv preprint 65 required for the antiviral activity of both IFITM3 and IFITM1 [9]. The subcellular localization of 66 IFITMs is a key determinant of their antiviral profile.

" The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cellular processes captured the attention of many researchers, since their dysregulation is shown to affect the cancer disease landscape by sustaining proliferative signaling, evading program cell death, and inhibiting growth suppressors. Thus, miRNAs have been considered important diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for several types of tumors. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be able to exploit the information contained in thousands of miRNAs to accurately predict and classify cancer types. Nevertheless, extracting the most relevant miRNA expressions is fundamental to allow human experts to validate and make sense of the results obtained by automatic algorithms. We propose a novel feature selection approach, able to identify the most important miRNAs for tumor classification, based on consensus on feature relevance from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. The proposed methodology is tested on a real-world dataset featuring 8,129 patients, 29 different types of tumors, and 1,046 miRNAs per patient, taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A new miRNA signature is suggested, containing the 100 most important oncogenic miRNAs identified by the presented approach. Such a signature is proved to be sufficient to identify all 29 types of cancer considered in the study, with results nearly identical to those obtained using all 1,046 features in the original dataset. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the medical literature is performed to find references to the most important biomarkers extracted by the methodology. Besides known oncomarkers, 15 new miRNAs previously not ranked as important biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer pathologies are uncovered. Such miRNAs, considered relevant by the machine learning algorithms, but still relatively unexplored by specialized literature, could provide further insights in the biology of cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. In the last years, the under and over expression of miRNAs has been related to the diagnosis and prognosis of specific cancer types.

" The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.

" Coronaviruses encode a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements 2 necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility for common targets for 3 attenuation and therapeutic design. In this study, we focus on the highly conserved non-4 structural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2'O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical 5 functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif 6 in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral 7 infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2'O MTase activity had only marginal impact 8 on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated 9 significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. 10 Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation 11 and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation 12 permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge 13 with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the 14 conserved 2'O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved 15 universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. 16 All rights reserved.

" Background. T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) 28 receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions. TIM-1 29 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains 30 unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have 31 suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a 32 BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein and demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 33 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. 34 Methodology/Principal findings. We used an infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus 35 expressing EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo 36 infection. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon α/β receptor -/mice were 37 challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV-GFP or G/rVSV-GFP. While G/rVSV caused profound 38 morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better 39 survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV 40 load in spleen was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in 41 serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, 42 suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher 43 virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-44 sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more 45 modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were 46 depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. 47 Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection. 48 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/466102 doi: bioRxiv preprint Conclusions. Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, 49 TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this 50 receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction 51 may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection. 52 53 Author summary 54 T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is one of a number of phosphatidylserine (PS) 55 receptors that mediate clearance of apoptotic bodies by binding PS on the surface of dead or 56 dying cells. Enveloped viruses mimic apoptotic bodies by exposing PS on the outer leaflet of the 57 viral membrane. While TIM-1 has been shown to serve as an adherence factor/receptor for 58 filoviruses in tissue culture, limited studies have investigated the role of TIM-1 as a receptor in 59 vivo. Here, we sought to determine if TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated 60 infection using a BSL2 model virus. We demonstrate that loss of TIM-1 expression results in 61 decreased virus load late during infection and significantly reduced virus-elicited mortality. 62 These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 serves as an important receptor for Ebola virus in 63 vivo. Blocking TIM-1/EBOV interactions may be effective antiviral strategy to reduce viral load 64 and pathogenicity at late times of EBOV infection. 65 66 .

" This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.","Prediction of COVID-19 Spreading Profiles in South Korea, Italy and Iran by Data-Driven Coding"
" Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a cindex of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, All rights reserved.

" The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. .

" Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL. visceral leishmaniasis | post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis | spatiotemporal transmission | transmission tree | Bayesian inference S patiotemporal heterogeneity in incidence is a hallmark of 1 infectious diseases. Insight into this heterogeneity has in-2 creased considerably in recent years due to greater availability 3 of geo-located individual-level epidemiological data and the 4 development of sophisticated statistical inference methods for 5 partially observed transmission processes (1-6). These meth-6 ods have been developed for epidemics, in which the immune 7 status of the population is known, and for diseases with a 8 short time course that are relatively easily diagnosed, such 9 as measles, influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease (3, 4, 7). Here, we extend these methods to a slowly progressing endemic 11 disease of humans in which asymptomatic infection plays an 12 important role. 13 We analyse detailed longitudinal individual-level data on 14 incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-15 kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic 16 community in Fulbaria, Bangladesh (8). VL, also known as 17 kala-azar, is a lethal sandfly-borne parasitic disease targeted 18 for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 19 people/year at subdistrict/district level depending on the 20 country) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) by 2020 (9). PKDL 21 is a non-lethal skin condition that occurs after treatment 22 for VL in 5-20% of cases in the ISC, and less frequently in 23 individuals who report no history of prior VL (8, 10). It is 24 characterised by skin lesions of di ering severity and parasite 25 load, ranging from macules and papules (least severe, lowest 26 load) to nodules (most severe, highest load) (11). We estimate 27 the relative contributions of di erent disease states (VL, PKDL 28 and asymptomatic infection) to transmission, and quantify the 29 rate of spread of infection around infected individuals in space 30 and time by reconstructing transmission trees. Our analysis 31 provides insight into the spatiotemporal spread of visceral 32 leishmaniasis as well as quantitative estimates that can guide 33 the targeting of interventions, such as active case detection 34 and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, around VL 35 Although methods for analysing individual-level geo-located disease data have existed for some time, they have rarely been used to analyse endemic human diseases. Here we apply such methods to nearly a decade's worth of uniquely detailed epidemiological data on incidence of the deadly vector-borne disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its secondary condition, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), to quantify the spread of infection around cases in space and time by inferring who infected whom, and estimate the relative contribution of different infection states to transmission. Our findings highlight the key role long diagnosis delays and PKDL play in maintaining VL transmission. This detailed characterisation of the spatiotemporal transmission of VL will help inform targeting of interventions around VL and PKDL cases. : medRxiv preprint 131 sion (over and above that from being at zero distance from 132 an infectious individual) and with di erent pre-symptomatic 133 and asymptomatic relative infectiousness.

" The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.",Fast assessment of human receptor-binding capability of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
" Human astroviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that contain three main open reading frames: ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide and have been associated with encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Through comparative genomic analysis of >400 astrovirus sequences, we identified a conserved ""ORFX"" overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. ORFX appears to be subject to purifying selection, consistent with it encoding a functional protein product, termed XP. Using ribosome profiling of cells infected with human astrovirus 1, we confirm initiation at the ORFX AUG. XP-knockout astroviruses are strongly attenuated and after passaging can partly restore viral titer via pseudo-reversions, thus demonstrating that XP plays an important role in virus growth. To further investigate XP, we developed an astrovirus replicon system. We demonstrate that XP has only minor effects on RNA replication and structural protein production. Instead, XP associates with the plasma membrane with an extracellular N-terminus topology and promotes efficient virus release. Using two different assays, we show that expression of human or related astrovirus XPs leads to cell permeabilization, suggesting a viroporin-like activity. The discovery of XP advances our knowledge of these important human viruses and opens a new direction of research into astrovirus replication and pathogenesis. They are considered to be the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in infants after rotavirus 1 . Recently, and especially in immunocompromised individuals, astroviruses have also .

Despite their undoubted importance, astroviruses still represent one of the least studied groups of human positive-sense RNA viruses. The genome contains three main open reading frames: ORF1a encoding a nonstructural polyprotein (nsP1a), ORF1b encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein (CP) (Fig. 1A) 3 . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA (gRNA), with expression of ORF1b depending on programmed ribosomal frameshifting whereby a proportion of ribosomes translating ORF1a make a −1 nucleotide shift into ORF1b. Frameshifting occurs at a conserved A_AAA_AAC sequence within the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region and depends on a 3′-adjacent stimulatory RNA stem-loop structure 4 . ORF2 is translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that is produced during virus infection. Previously, using comparative genomics we identified a conserved fourth ORF (ORFX) in genogroup I astroviruses, which appears to be subject to purifying selection and therefore is likely to encode a functional protein product, termed the X protein (XP, 12 kDa, 112 aa) 5 . ORFX overlaps the 5′ region of the capsid-encoding ORF2 and is predicted to be translatable via ribosomal leaky scanning, which is expected to be enhanced by the very short leader on the sgRNA 3,6,7 . However, despite the comparative genomic predictions, the existence, relevance, and function of XP have never been demonstrated. Here we perform a functional molecular dissection of ORFX, providing insight into the simultaneous orchestration of several overlapping functional elements in a small human-pathogenic RNA virus. We show that ORFX is translated during virus infection, XP knockout mutant viruses are highly attenuated, and XP is a transmembrane (TM) protein that promotes efficient virus release via a viroporin-like activity. Through an extended bioinformatic analysis, we predict that related XP proteins are widely encoded in other mammalian astroviruses including the divergent ""MLB"" group of human-infecting astroviruses. Comparative genomic analysis reveals a potential ORFX in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. Since there are many more astrovirus sequences available now than in 2010, we began by repeating our previous comparative genomic analysis but this time also extending to other astrovirus genogroups.

" The emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses. Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection. Moreover, our provided protocol can be extended for testing the other 66 provided designs.

" Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13 th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, R t , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23 rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of R t ,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.",Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study
" Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) challenge the well-established sequence-structurefunction paradigm for describing protein function and evolution. Here, we direct a combination of biophysical and cellular studies to further our understanding of how the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of FtsZ contributes to cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Zring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be ""just right"" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.",Evolved sequence features within the intrinsically disordered tail influence FtsZ assembly and bacterial cell division
" 30 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse 31 vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, 32 with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance.

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans. 69 .

Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or 76 domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10]. 77 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and 78 highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17].

" Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants, large 27 zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential of 28 a diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, evolution and drug 29 resistance, and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply Oxford 30 Nanopore Technology to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated 31 influenza reads down to a limit of detection of 10 2 -10 3 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, 32 observing a strong relationship between the viral titre and the proportion of influenza reads (p = 33 4.7x10 -5 ). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza reads for 27/27 34 samples with high-to-mid viral titres (Cycle threshold (Ct) values <30) and 6/13 samples with low 35 viral titres (Ct values 30-40). No false positive reads were generated from 10 influenza-negative 36 samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% CI 67-93%) and 100% 37 specificity (95% CI 69-100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard.

" Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections 17 and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary 18 camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or 19 humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like 20 protease (PL pro ) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing 21 functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PL pro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can 22 remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. 23 In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with ubiquitin, 24 facilitating the design of PL pro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein 25 cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and 26 examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. 27 Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was 28 comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels 29 for interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the 30 survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic 31 mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV 32 replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, 33 likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to 34 delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first 35 direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion 36 and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate 37 immune-suppressive DUB activity of PL pro s is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the 38 context of rational vaccine development.",The deubiquitinating activity of Middle East respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus papain-like protease delays the innate immune response 3 and enhances virulence in a mouse model 4 5 Robert

" The process of molecular adaptation following a cross-species virus transmission event is 9 currently poorly understood. Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration 10 in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and 11 consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species 12 transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation 13 strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in 14 accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors 15 are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-16 pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than 17 the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher 18 when the genetic distance of the hosts increases.

Knockout and overexpression of EPS8 confirmed its importance in enhancing FLUAV infection and titers. Loss of EPS8 did not affect virion attachment, uptake, or fusion. Rather, our data show that EPS8 specifically functions during virion uncoating. EPS8 physically associated with incoming virion components, and subsequent nuclear import of released ribonucleoprotein complexes was significantly delayed in the absence of EPS8. Our study identified EPS8 as a host factor important for uncoating, a crucial step of FLUAV infection during which the interface between the virus and host is still being discovered.",EPS8 facilitates uncoating of influenza A virus
" Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the rst few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedestransmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (Chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of nal epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks. Model-based assessments must be done in real time for emerging outbreaks: this was the case in recent years for MERS-CoV in the Middle East [1, 2, 3], Ebola virus in West Africa [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [11] and Zika virus (ZIKV) [12, 13, 14] in the Americas. These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is dicult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [15] . Yet, it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that forecasts would help public health authorities decide on the best strategies for control or mitigation. Several methods have been used to make epidemic predictions, including exponential growth models [5, 16] , sigmoid-based extrapolations [17] , SIR-type models [18] and more realistic model 1 .

" BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results.

Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.",Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model
" Binge eating (BE) is a heritable symptom of eating disorders with an unknown genetic etiology. 32 Rodent models for BE of palatable food permit the study of genetic and biological mechanisms. 33 We previously used genetic mapping and transcriptome analysis to map a coding mutation in 34 Cyfip2 associated with increased BE in the BE-prone C57BL/6NJ substrain compared to the BE-35 resistant C57BL/6J substrain. The increase in BE in C57BL/6NJ mice was associated with a 36 decrease in transcription of genes enriched for myelination in the striatum. Here, we tested the 37 hypothesis that decreasing myelin levels with the demyelinating agent cuprizone would enhance 38 BE. Mice were treated with a 0.3% cuprizone home cage diet for two weeks. Following a three-39 week recovery period, mice were trained for BE in an intermittent, limited access procedure. 40 Cuprizone induced similar weight loss in both substrains and sexes that recovered within 48 h 41 after removal of the cuprizone diet. Surprisingly, cuprizone reduced BE in male but not female 42 C57BL/6NJ mice while having no effect in C57BL/6J mice. Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic 43 protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-44 associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point. C57BL/6N mice also showed less MBP than 45 C57BL/6J mice. There were no statistical interactions of Treatment with Sex on MBP levels, 46 indicating that differences in MBP are unlikely to account for sex differences in BE. To summarize, 47 cuprizone induced an unexpected, male-specific reduction in BE which could indicate sex-specific 48 biological mechanisms that depend on genetic background. 49 50 KEY WORDS: binge eating disorder, demyelination, sex differences, reduced complexity cross, 51 QTL, sex as a biological variable 52",The demyelinating agent cuprizone induces a male-specific reduction in binge eating in 2 the binge-prone C57BL/6NJ strain 3 4
" Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we 26 have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl 27 transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the 28 context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F 29 (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and 30 enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique 31 recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH 32 being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits 33 biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for 34 recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to 35 speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven 36 nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible 37 to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may 38 permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a 39 background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity. 40 41 Significance 42 The availability of a ""universal"" method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would 43 permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged 44 as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, 45 the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be 46 futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the 47 existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism 48 .

We conclude that the field will be served best by continued 49 emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of 50 individual properties. 51 52 56 pathogens), viral outbreaks over the past few decades have been caused by viruses for which 57 surveillance was not considered a priority. Rapid response to an outbreak caused by an unexpected 58 viral pathogen requires, minimally, the existence of broad-spectrum, antiviral therapeutics. Prevention 59 requires the availability of vaccines, development of which could take years. Indeed, approved 60 vaccines still do not exist to prevent infections by West Nile virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome 61 (SARS) coronavirus, and these outbreaks occurred more than one decade ago. 62 Because all RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with conserved 63 function and mechanism, this enzyme has emerged as an attractive target for development of broad-64 spectrum therapeutics (1-3) and a target for function/mechanism-based strategies for viral attenuation 65 (4-9). One function/mechanism of the RdRp that has been targeted most is that required for faithful 66 incorporation of nucleotides (4-9). Changing RdRp fidelity decreases or increases the genetic variation 67 of the viral population, which, in turn, decreases fitness and virulence of the viral population (10-15). 68 Known RdRp variants exhibiting a high-fidelity phenotype can also exhibit a reduced speed of 69 nucleotide incorporation, at least at the biochemical level (16). Replication speed is also a determinant 70 of viral fitness and virulence (17). So, is it the increased fidelity or decreased speed of nucleotide 71 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/769224 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 addition that gives rise to the attenuated phenotype? Further complicating the fidelity-versus-speed 72 question are the recent observations that changes to fidelity also have consequence for the efficiency of 73 recombination (18-23). Increased RdRp fidelity decreases recombination efficiency and vice versa 74 (18-23). It will likely be impossible to attribute a single biochemical property of the RdRp to 75 biological outcome. 76 The most extensively studied PV fidelity mutants encode RdRps with amino acid substitutions at 77 sites remote from the active site. Constructing equivalent substitutions conferring equivalent 78 phenotypes in RdRps other than PV is difficult if not impossible. Our laboratory has therefore pursued 79 active-site-based strategies to manipulate the fidelity, speed, and/or recombination efficiency of the 80 RdRp (24). We have shown that a lysine (Lys-359 in PV) present in conserved structural motif D of 81 the RdRp contributes to the efficiency of nucleotidyl transfer (24). A PV mutant encoding a K359R 82 RdRp is attenuated but elicits a protective immune response in mice that is at least as robust as the 83 immune response elicited by the type 1 Sabin vaccine strain (6). In this study, we characterize a second motif-D mutant of PV (K359H). Unlike the K359R RdRp-85 encoding virus (6), K359H PV is genetically unstable and acquires mutations encoding two second-site 86 amino acid substitutions after a few passages in cell culture. Together, the two substitutions restore all 87 biochemical properties of the derivative to near wild-type levels. Individually, however, we observe 88 differences in the mechanism (copy-choice vs. forced-copy-choice) and efficiency of recombination by 89 each derivative, although each derivative exhibits equivalent speed and fidelity. We conclude that 90 biochemical properties in addition to speed and fidelity must exist and contribute to both the 91 mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The desire to attribute single, biochemical properties of 92 the viral RdRp to fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis may be futile. Results K359H PV requires two second-site substitutions to restore a ""wild-type"" growth phenotype 96 Most studies of RdRp fidelity have benefited from the selection of derivatives that were either 97 more or less sensitive to a mutagenic nucleoside (25-30). Almost invariably, the derivatives changed 98 residues remote from the catalytic site, thus using an allosteric mechanism to perturb fidelity. Among 99 the most famous of these is the G64S substitution in PV RdRp (15, 16, 26). Many years ago, our 100 laboratory showed that the active site of all polymerases contain a general acid, Lys-359 in the case of 101 PV RdRp, that protonated the pyrophosphate leaving group during nucleotidyl transfer, thereby 102 increasing the catalytic efficiency of RdRp (24). Substitutions of Lys-359 in PV RdRp give rise to 103 changes in fidelity (6, 17). The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine 104 substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type (24).","North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 125 Mason Farm Rd"
" Knowledge of the host factors required for norovirus replication has been hindered 2 by the challenges associated with culturing human noroviruses. We have combined 3 proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR 4 screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress 5 granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient 6 human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across 7 the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel 8 paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of 9 translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by 10 facilitating 40S recruitment. Our data suggest that G3BP1 functions by providing viral 11 RNA a competitive advantage over capped cellular RNAs, uncovering a novel 12 function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifying the 13 first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity. 14 15 16",Noroviruses subvert the core stress granule component G3BP1 to promote viral VPg-dependent translation
" The basal ganglia and thalamus play an important role in cognition, procedural learning, eye movements, control of voluntary motor movements, emotional control, habit development, and are structures that are severely impacted by neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or Tourette syndrome. To understand the structural connectivity of cortical and subcortical circuits in the healthy human brain could thus be of pivotal importance for detecting changes in this circuitry and to start early intervention, to assess the progress of movement rehabilitation, or the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatry. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, or magnetoencephalography are able to provide detailed information about connectivity at the macro level, the sensitivity and specificity these imaging techniques put limits on the amount of detail one can obtain when measuring in vivo connectivity of human basal ganglia and thalamus. In contrast, the multiband diffusion echo planar imaging MRI sequence, which acquires multiple slices of the brain simultaneously, enables high resolution imaging of these brain structures with only short acquisition times at 3-Tesla field strength. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that allows us to generate comprehensive in vivo participant-specific probabilistic patterns and visualizations of the structural connections that exist within basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Moreover, we are able to map specific parcellations of these nuclei into sub-territories based on their connectivity with primary motor-, and somatosensory cortex. The detailed subcortical structural connectivity mapping introduced in this work could benefit early intervention and therapy methods for human movement rehabilitation and for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. author/funder.

" While RNA viruses thrive with massive structural and functional diversity, their genomes size variation is particularly low, ranging only from ∼ 2-to-33 kb. Here, I present the characterization of RNA sequences corresponding to the first virus associated with Aplysia californica. Genome structure and domain architecture suggest that the identified virus is a novel member of Nidovirales. The proposed aplysia californica nido-like virus (AcNV), with a genome sequence of ca.35,906 nt, represents the longest ever recorded RNA virus yet. Phylogenetic insights indicate that AcNV clusters in a major phylloclade of unclassified invertebrate nidoviruses, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae. Basal branching in this emerging cluster could indicate that AcNV is a member of a novel divergent clade within Nidovirales. Further, virus RNA detection in multiple independent studies suggests that AcNV is neurotropic with a broad cell/tissue/organ tropism, supported by AcNV occurrence in diverse organs, including the first detection of a Nidovirales in single specific neurons.","Expanding the size limit of RNA viruses: Evidence of a novel divergent nidovirus in California sea hare, with a ∼ 35.9 kb virus genome"
" Infections by RNA viruses such as Influenza, HIV still pose a serious threat to human health despite extensive research on viral diseases. One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results: We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction.

" Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 . In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP. author/funder.

" The effective reproduction number, Rt, is an important prognostic for 2 infectious disease epidemics. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about 3 new transmissions or predict the efficacy of interventions. The renewal 4 model infers Rt from incidence data and has been applied to Ebola virus 5 disease and pandemic influenza outbreaks, among others. This model 6 estimates Rt using a sliding window of length k. While this facilitates 7 real-time detection of statistically significant Rt fluctuations, inference is 8 highly k -sensitive. Models with too large or small k might ignore meaning-9 ful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones. No principled k -selection 10 scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the ac-11 cumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory. We 12 derive exact incidence prediction distributions and integrate these within 13 an APE framework to identify the k best supported by available data. We 14 find that this k optimises short-term prediction accuracy and expose how 15 common, heuristic k -choices, which seem sensible, could be misleading. 16 18 fectious disease epidemic is known as an incidence curve or epi-curve [1]. At 19 the population level, these curves offer prospective insight into the spread of a 20 disease by informing on the effective reproduction number, which defines the 21 average number of secondary infections induced by a primary one [2]. This 22 reproduction number, denoted R t at time t, is an important prognostic of the 23 behaviour of an epidemic. If R t > 1, for example, we can expect and hence 24 prepare for an exponentially increasing incidence, whereas if R t < 1, we can be 25 1 .

Reliably estimat-26 ing meaningful changes in R t is an important problem in epidemiology, since 27 it can forewarn about the growth rate of an outbreak and signify the level of 28 control effort that must be initiated or sustained [3] [4]. 29 The renewal model [5] is a popular approach for inferring salient fluctuations 30 in R t and has been used to predict Ebola virus disease case counts and assess the 31 transmission potential of pandemic influenza and Zika virus, among others [6] [7] 32 [3]. The renewal model may be applied retrospectively to understand the past 33 behaviour of an epidemic or prospectively to gain real-time insight into ongoing 34 outbreak dynamics [8] [5]. We only consider the latter here. Model selection 35 metrics for the former application were investigated in [9]. The prospective ap-36 proach approximates R t with a piecewise-constant function i.e. R t is considered 37 constant or stable over some sliding window of k time units (e.g. days or weeks) 38 into the past, beyond which a discontinuous change is assumed [8]. 39 This formulation models the non-stationary nature of epidemics, capturing 40 the idea that different dynamics are expected during distinct phases (e.g. onset, 41 growth, control) of the epidemic lifetime. The window length, k, is effectively a 42 hypothesis about the stability of R t underpinning the observed epi-curve and is 43 critical to reliably characterising the epidemic because it controls the time-scale 44 over which R t fluctuations are deemed significant. Too large or small a k-value 45 can respectively lead to over-smoothing (which ignores important changes) or 46 to random noise being misinterpreted as meaningful. Inferring under the wrong 47 k can appreciably affect our understanding of an epidemic, as observed in [5], 48 where case reproduction numbers (a common k-grouping of R t ) were found to 49 over-smooth significant changes in HIV transmission, for example. 50 Surprisingly, no principled method for optimally selecting k exists. Current 51 best practice either relies on heuristic choices (including visual trial and error) [6] 52 or provides implicit, minimum thresholds for k [8]. Here we adapt metrics from 53 information theory to develop a simple yet rigorous framework for optimising k. 54 Specifically, we analytically derive the posterior predictive incidence distribution 55 of the renewal model and then minimise its accumulated prediction error (APE) 56 [10] over the space of possible k, to obtain k * . The APE is a formal, data-57 driven, model selection strategy that identifies the k * most justified by the 58 available incidence data by optimising for short-term predictive accuracy [11] . The renewal model with this k * best explains the observed epi-curve. The APE metric is valid for all sample sizes, is easily computed for models of 61 arbitrary dimension and is strongly linked to Bayesian model selection (BMS), 62 cross validation and minimum description length (MDL) [12] [13]. Unlike many 63 standard model selection approaches, the APE accounts for parametric com-64 plexity, which describes how functional dependencies among parameters matter 65 [14]. Ignoring parametric complexity is known to promote suboptimal renewal 66 model selection performance [9]. The APE metric deems the model that best 67 predicts unseen data from the same underlying process, and not the one that 68 best fits existing data, as optimal and of justified complexity [15]. Our APE-based approach should therefore pinpoint and characterise only 70 those reproduction number fluctuations that are key to achieving reliable short- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The performance, speed and computational ease of 72 our approach makes it suitable for real-time forecasting and model selection. It could serve as a stand-alone computational tool or be integrated within ex-74 isting real-time frameworks, such as in [4], to provide emerging insights into 75 infectious transmission dynamics, or to assess the prospective efficacy of im-76 plemented interventions (e.g. vaccination or quarantine). Public health policy 77 decisions or preparedness plans based on improperly specified k-windows could 78 be misinformed or overconfident. Our approach will hopefully limit these risks. 79 Results 80 Problem Definition 81 Let the incidence or number of infected cases in an epidemic at present time t, 82 be I t . The incidence curve is a historical record of these case counts from the 83 start of the outbreak [1], and is summarised as I t 1 = {I s : 1 ≤ s ≤ t}, with s as a 84 time-indexing variable. For convenience, we assume that incidence is available 85 on a daily scale so that I t 1 is a vector of t daily counts (though in general weeks 86 or months could be used instead). The associated effective reproduction number 87 and total infectiousness of the epidemic are denoted R t and Λ t , respectively. 88 Here R t is the number of secondary cases that are induced, on average, by 89 a single primary case at t [2], while Λ t measures the cumulative impact of past 90 cases, from the epidemic origin at s = 1, on the present. The generation time 91 distribution of the epidemic, which describes the elapsed time between a primary 92 and secondary case, controls Λ t (see Methods). In the problems we consider, I t 1 93 and Λ t 1 form our data, the generation time distribution is assumed known, and 94 R t 1 or some grouping of this vector are the parameters to be inferred. 95 The renewal model [5] [6] derives from the classic renewal epidemic trans-96 mission equation [26], and defines the Poisson distributed (Poiss) relationship 97 I t ∼ Poiss (R t Λ t ). This means that P(x) = 1 /x! e −RtΛt (R t Λ t ) x , with x in-98 dexing possible I t values. This formulation assumes maximum epidemic non-99 stationarity (i.e. that transmission statistics change every time unit) and hence 100 only uses the most recent data (I t , Λ t ) to infer the current R t . While this max-101 imises the fitting flexibility of the renewal model, it often results in noisy and 102 unreliable estimates that possess many spurious reproduction number changes 103 [6]. Consequently, grouping is employed. This hypothesises that the repro-104 duction number is constant over a k-day window into the past and leads to a 105 piecewise-constant function that separates salient fluctuations (change-points) 106 from negligible ones (the constant segments) [8] [9]. 107 We use R τ (t) to indicate that the present reproduction number to be inferred 108 is stationary (constant) over the last k points of the incidence curve i.e. the time 109 window τ (t) := {t, t − 1, . . . , t − k + 1}. The data used to estimate R τ (t) is 110 then (I t t−k+1 , Λ t t−k+1 ). This construction allows us to filter noise and increase 111 estimate reliability but elevates bias. In the Methods we show precisely how 112 grouping achieves this bias-variance trade-off. Choosing k therefore amounts to 113 3 .

Thus, it is necessary to find a principled method for balancing 116 k. Ultimately, we want to find a k, denoted k * , that (i) is best supported by 117 the epi-curve and (ii) maximises our confidence in making real-time, short-term 118 predictions that can inform prospective epidemic responses. 119 This is no trivial task as k * would be sensitive to both the specifically ob-120 served stochastic incidence of an epidemic and to how past infections propagate 121 forward in time. We solve (i)-(ii) by applying the accumulated prediction error 122 (APE) metric from information theory [10], which values models on their capac-123 ity to predict unseen data from the generating process instead of their ability to 124 fit existing data [11]. The properties and mathematical definition of the APE 125 355 cept I s+1 are included [21]. Comparing this to Eq. (9) (see Methods) we see 356 that APE is a modified CV that is explicitly specialised for non-stationary, 357 accumulating time-series. (c) Lack of a 'true model'. It is highly unlikely that the underlying R t is truly 359 described by one of the piecewise-constant functions assumed within renewal 360 models. Unlike many model selection criteria, the APE does not require a true 361 model to exist within the set being evaluated [14]. It is only interested in finding 362 the model that best predicts the data and so emphasises accurate forecasting 363 and data-justified complexity. However, should a true model exist, the APE is 364 statistically consistent i.e. as data accumulate it will select the data-generating 365 model with probability 1 [14]. 366 We tested our metric on both simulated and empirical datasets. We started 367 by examining various distinct, time-varying reproduction number profiles in 368 Fig. 2 , for which no true model existed. By comparing the APE-optimised 369 k * against long and short window sizes, we found that not only does APE 370 meaningfully balance R t estimates to achieve good prediction capacity, but also 371 that getting k wrong could promote strikingly different conclusions from the 372 same dataset. This behaviour held consistent for outbreaks with both small 373 and large numbers of infecteds. 374 We then investigated several step-changing reproduction number examples 375 in Fig. 4 to better expose the underlying mechanics of our approach, and to 376 showcase its performance on epidemics with strong non-stationary transmission. These examples featured rapid changes, also known as events in information 378 theory, caused by effective and ineffective countermeasures [4]. In all cases, our 379 metric responded rapidly whilst maintaining reliable incidence predictions in 380 real-time. Such rapid, event-triggered responses (as in Fig. 5) are known to 381 be time-efficient [22]. A key objective of short-term forecasting is the speedy 382 diagnosis of intervention efficacy. Fig. 4 confirmed the practical value of our 383 method towards this objective. 384 While our metric is promising, we caution that much work remains to be 385 done. Standard Poisson renewal models, such as those we have considered here, 386 make several limiting assumptions including that (i) all cases are detected (i.e. 387 there is no significant sampling bias), (ii) the serial interval and generation time 388 distribution coincide and do not change over the epidemic lifetime and (iii) that 389 heterogeneities in transmission within the infected population have negligible 390 effect [8]. Our analysis of H1N1 influenza (1918) and SARS (2003) flagged 391 some of these concerns. Comparing the k * to previously recommended weekly 392 windows led to some interesting revelations. The APE approach selected a notably shorter window (k * = 2 days) for both 394 datasets. While this produced noisy R s estimates that seemed less reliable than 395 those obtained with weekly windows, the predicted incidence values were central 396 to understanding this discrepancy. The weekly windows were considerably worse 397 at forecasting the observed epi-curve, often systematically biased around the 398 peak of the epidemic and sometimes predicting multi-modal curves that were 399 not reflected by the existing data. From a model selection perspective, the 400 shorter windows are therefore justified. 401 However, the noisy R t estimates are still undesirable. Both datasets are 402 known to potentially contain super-spreading heterogeneities and other biases 403 that may lead to outliers [17] [8]. Moving-average filters were applied in [17] 404 15 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/835181 doi: bioRxiv preprint to remove these artefacts from the H1N1 data. We used the same technique 405 to regularise both datasets and then re-applied the APE. Results remained 406 consistent, providing evidence for the use of more flexible negative binomial 407 renewal models, which can better handle these biases. In an upcoming study 408 we will adapt the APE for these more general renewal methods. 409 Real-time, model-based epidemic forecasts are quickly becoming an inte-410 gral prognostic for resource allocation and strategic intervention planning [23]. 411 As global infectious disease threats elevate, model-supported predictions, which 412 can inform decision making, have become imperative. However, much is still un-413 known about the fundamentals of epidemic prediction and this uncertainty has 414 inspired some reluctance in public health applications [23]. As a result, recent 415 studies have called for careful evaluation of the predictive capacity of models, 416 and demonstrated the importance of having standard metrics to compare models 417 and qualify their uncertainties [24] [25]. 418 Here we have presented one such metric. Short-term forecasts aid immedi-419 ate decision making and are more actionable than long-term ones (reliability 420 decreases sharply with prediction horizon) [24] [23]. While we focussed on re-421 newal models, the general APE metric of Eq. (9) can select among diverse types 422 of models, facilitating comparative evaluation of their short-term predictive ca-423 pacity and reliability. Its direct use of posterior predictive distributions within 424 an honest, causal framework allows proper and problem-specific inclusion of 425 uncertainty [11]. Common metrics such as the mean absolute error lack this 426 adaptation [24]. Given its information-theoretic links and demonstrated perfor-427 mance we hope that our APE-based method can serve as a rigorous benchmark 428 [9] K. Parag and C.

" Bio-fluids contain various circulating cell-free RNA transcripts (ccfRNAs). The composition of 20 these ccfRNAs varies between bio-fluids and constitute tantalizing biomarker candidates for 21 several pathologies. ccfRNAs have also been demonstrated as mediators of cellular 22 communication, yet little is known about their function in physiological and developmental 23 settings and most works are limited to in-vitro studies. Here, we have developed iTAG-RNA, a 24 novel method for the unbiased tagging of RNA transcripts in mice in-vivo. We used this method 25 to isolate hepatocytes and kidney proximal epithelial cells-specific transcriptional response to a 26 dietary challenge without interfering with the tissue architecture, and to identify multiple 27 hepatocyte-secreted ccfRNAs in plasma. We also identified transfer of these hepatic derived 28 ccfRNAs to adipose tissue, where they likely serve as a buffering mechanism to maintain 29 cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Our findings directly demonstrate in-vivo transfer of RNAs 30 between tissues and highlight its implications for endocrine signaling and homeostasis. Little is known about the biological function of circulating cell-free RNAs (ccfRNA). Found to be 34 associated with exosomes, lipoproteins, ribonucleoproteins and more, these transcripts can be 35 isolated and sequenced from multiple bio-fluids such as plasma, lymph, cerebral fluids, breast milk 36 and more [1, 2]. ccfRNAs are directly implicated in the development of several pathologies 37 including cancer and obesity [3][4][5] and are intensively studied as disease biomarkers [6, 7]. Despite 38 this, the role they play in physiological and developmental settings and in mediating cell-to-cell 39 communication remains largely unknown. In-vitro, a growing number of works demonstrate the 40 relevance of RNA based cellular communication [8][9][10][11], however in-vivo evidence is still limited. This discrepancy is partly due to the difficulties posed to tracking ccfRNAs from transcriptional 42 source to potential sites of action in-vivo. Indeed the tools available to study ccfRNAs in 43 physiological settings are limited and very few studies attempt to tackle this problem directly. One work found evidence to suggest that the majority of circulating miRNAs originate in adipose 45 tissue and that some of the adipose derived miRNAs may play a role in the regulation of liver 46 Fgf21 levels [12]. However, this work focuses on miRNA and does not directly demonstrate 47 transfer of RNAs between tissues nor directly identify adipose secreted RNAs. Transfer of miRNAs was also demonstrated between epithelial cells of the caput epididymis to 49 maturing spermatozoa, leading to a shift in sperm RNA content during its maturation [13]. This 50 study made use of 4-thiouracil-tagging (TU-tagging) [14] combined with SLAM-Seq [15] to 51 demonstrate loading of miRNAs transcribed in caput epididymis into maturing spermatozoa. TU-52 tagging entails cell-type specific expression of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) and 53 administration of 4-thiouracil, with the assumption that only cells expressing UPRT would 54 incorporate 4-thiouracil into transcribing RNA. Thio-RNA can then be purified and used for 55 downstream gene expression analyses, or alternatively combined with SLAM-Seq to identify 56 labeled transcripts. TU-tagging has proven useful in several additional systems [14, 16, 17], 57 however, given endogenous [18] and alternative [19] pathways for uracil incorporation, the 58 labeling specificity in this method remains unclear. In addition, as is demonstrated in Herzog et. 59 al [15] and by Sharma et. al [13], labeling with TU-tagging of PolI and PolIII transcripts is 60 inefficient, rendering tRNAs and ribosomal transcripts unlabeled. Indeed there are only a limited number of techniques enabling in-vivo targeted labeling of RNAs. 62 In addition to TU-tagging, 5-ethynylcytosine-tagging (EC-tagging) [20] is a new method, which 63 utilizes cell-type specific co-expression of cytosine deaminase (CD) with UPRT to achieve RNA 64 labeling with 5-ethynyluridine (5EU) following administration of 5-ethynylcytosine. Both TU and 65 EC tagging use cre-recombination to express the relevant enzymes in a tissue specific manner and 66 stochastic expression from the cre-promoter may lead to unwanted expression of the enzymes in 67 different tissues [21]. Finally, one recently developed method called Mime-seq allows for cell type 68 specific labeling of microRNA [22]. In this method, tissue specific expression of a plant derived 69 methyltransferase mediates a 3′-terminal 2′-O-methylation of microRNAs that, when combined 70 with a methylation dependent library construction, allows for sequencing of tissue specific 71 microRNAs. Mime-seq allows labeling of miRNAs alone leaving other RNA biotypes unlabeled. 72 Given the need for a technique that allows for a Cre-independent and unbiased labeling of total 73 RNA transcription in-vivo, we developed iTAG-RNA [For In-vivo Targeted Tagging of RNA]. 74 This method incorporates mouse genetics with a novel uridine analog and an established RNA 75 labeling chemistry to allow tagging of total RNA in target cells in-vivo. Using iTAG-RNA we are 76 able to identify transcriptional re-programming of hepatocytes in-vivo following an acute high fat 77 diet stress and to enrich for and identify hepatocyte derived plasma ccfRNAs. Moreover, we are 78 able to identify RNA-based liver-to-adipose RNA transfer. These liver derived ccfRNAs include 79 variable coding and non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs and tRNAs. Among the miRNAs 80 transferred from liver to adipose tissue we find mir-33, mir-10b and mir130a, which target major 81 regulators of cholesterol and lipid efflux and bio-synthesis such as Srebf1 [23], Abca1 [23, 24], 82 Ppara [25] and Pparg [26] respectively. 83 Our study demonstrates for the first time an unbiased technique that allows labelling, tracking and 84 quantification of variable types of ccfRNAs from their transcriptional source to downstream 85 tissues, in which they can potentially act to regulate expression of target genes. We demonstrate 86 RNA-based liver-to-adipose transfer of a myriad of RNA transcripts and their response to an 87 environmental challenge. The continued identification and characterization of RNA based 88 signaling in-vivo is imperative for the understanding of developmental, physiological and 89 pathological processes, and can aid in the future development of relevant disease biomarkers. 90 91 Results .

" The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel 28 betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-29 CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of 30 causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a 31 novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea 32 syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus 33 of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 34 (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it 35 can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is 36 determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in 37 viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM 38 structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 39 3.55 Å. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit 40 quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit 41 pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with 42 that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-43 CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, 44 such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by 45 glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data 46 provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and 47 would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which 48 .",Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein 1 provides insights into an evolution of unique coronavirus spike proteins 2 3
" Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3'-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.",Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases
" Viruses must hijack cellular translation machinery to efficiently express viral genes. In many 17 cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses swiftly relocate 18 and repurpose translation machinery, resulting in global inhibition of translation and the 19 aggregation of stalled 48S mRNPs into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules. This results in 20 translational silencing of all mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the 21 specific stress. For example, expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis 23 virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling 25 pathways whilst at the same time IBV replication also results in induction of seemingly 26 canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples 27 translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of 28 eIF2α phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular 29 translation and antiviral stress signaling. 30 31 32 105 Cells, viruses and reagents 106 Vero cells were maintained in 1x Eagle's modified essential medium (Sigma) supplemented 107 with 1x L-glutamine (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma).

Briefly, virus was incubated in 0.1 M BEI for 48 110 hours at 37 o C followed by inactivation of BEI by addition of 1 M sodium thiosulfate.

" Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the 12 tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (""target"") tRNAs to 13 recognize multiple codons and cover for other (""non-target"") tRNAs, often improving translation 14 efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying 15 enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 16 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly 17 lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target 18 tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome 19 reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene 20 repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing 21 the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. 22 23",THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND IMPACT OF BACTERIAL tRNA 1 MODIFICATIONS 2
" Dickeya species are high consequence plant pathogenic bacteria listed among the quarantine pathogens of the European Union; associated with potato disease outbreaks and subsequent economic losses worldwide. Early, accurate, and reliable detection of Dickeya spp. is needed to prevent establishment and further dissemination of this pathogen. Therefore, a multiplex TaqMan qPCR was developed for sensitive detection of Dickeya spp. and specifically, D. dianthicola. A signature genomic region for the genus Dickeya (mglA/mglC) and unique genomic region for D. dianthicola (alcohol dehydrogenase) were identified using a whole genome based comparative genomics approach. The developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR was validated using extensive inclusivity and exclusivity panels, and naturally/artificially infected samples to confirm broad range detection capability and specificity. Both sensitivity and spiked assays showed detection limit of 10 fg DNA. The developed multiplex assay is sensitive and reliable to detect Dickeya spp. and D. dianthicola with no false positives or false negatives. It was able to detect mixed infection from naturally and artificially infected plant materials. The developed assay will serve as a practical tool for screening of propagative material, monitoring the presence and distribution, and quantification of target pathogens in a breeding program. The assay also has applications in routine diagnostics, biosecurity and microbial forensics.",Comparative genomics reveals signature regions used to develop a robust and sensitive multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR assay to detect the genus Dickeya and Dickeya dianthicola
" Background: Developing methods to reconstruct transmission histories for viral outbreaks could provide critical information to support locating sources of disease transmission. Phylogenetic methods used to measure the degree of relatedness among sequenced viral samples have proven useful in identifying potential outbreak sources. The complex nature of infectious disease, however, makes it difficult to assign a rigorously defined quantitative confidence value assessing the likelihood of a true direct transmission event using genetic data alone. Results: A new method is presented to calculate a confidence value assessing the likelihood of a transmission event using both phylogenetic inference and limited knowledge of incubation and infectious duration times. The method is applied to simulations of a foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak to demonstrate how the combination of both phylogenetic and epidemiology data can be used to strengthen the assessment of the likelihood of direct transmission over methods using just phylogenetic data or infection timing data alone. The method is applied to a previous FMD outbreak to identify areas where over confidence in previously inferred direct transmission may exist. Conclusion: Combining knowledge from viral evolution and epidemiology within a single integrated transmission inference framework is an important approach to assess the potential likelihood of transmission events and makes clear how specific features of a virus' spread through the course of an outbreak will directly determine the potential for confidence in inferred host transmission links. Background Developing methods to protect against RNA virus outbreaks in the face of constantly changing disease dynamics remains one of the great public health challenges of our time. One small piece of this problem involves determining the host-pathogen transmission history to identify an outbreak's origin. In recent cases such as the 2003 SARS outbreak [1, 2], H5N1 influenza [3] infection in humans and Marburgvirus [4], phylogenetic inference has been used to help identify potential outbreak sources. Typically, a collection of sequences from candidate related sources are compared to infer transmission links between the most closely related sequences. These methods have been used beyond the public health domain to provide evidence in HIV [5, 6] and other forensic investigations [7] to help infer when a suspect is involved in infecting a victim. P (δ, σ|M ) rather than P (δ|M ). This reflects the desire to estimate the probability of observing the genetic relation δ in conjunction with infection related timing values for the transmission hypothesis M .

" The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel 28 coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated 29 with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of 30 zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of 31 any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the 32 identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in 33 anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin 34 associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, 35 including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The 36 discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV 37 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel 38 human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",
" 14 Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) 15 following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening 16 programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and 17 epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will 18 miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening 19 successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally 20 undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were 21 exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill 22 after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive 23 use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We 24 hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to 25 prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.",
" Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories although 37 how they assemble remains unknown. 38 During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by 39 the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this post-translational 40 modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on the virus replication 41 remains obscure. Here we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by 42 taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse genetics system. An NSP5 43 trans-complementing cell line was used to generate and characterise several 44 recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that a 45 rRV lacking NSP5, was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to 46 replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. 47 A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to 48 further interrogate the function of this post-translational modification in the 49 assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant 50 strains exhibit impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped 51 viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism of 52 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-53 negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines 54 expressing either wt NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results 55 indicate that NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of 56 round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 57 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 58 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional 59 viral factories in other RNA viruses. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

The non-structural 69 protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during 70 RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. 71 However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been 72 directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse genetics (RG) 73 system for rotaviruses. Here we show a novel application of a recently developed 74 RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell 75 line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach 76 allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein 77 during RV replication.

" One of the key characteristics of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the generation time which refers to the time interval between the infection of a secondary case and the infection of its infector. The generation time distribution together with the reproduction number determines the rate at which an infection spreads in a population. When defining the generation time distribution at a calendar time t two definitions are plausible according whether we regard t as the infection time of the infector or the infection time of the infectee. The resulting measurements are respectively called forward generation time and backward generation time. It has been observed that the mean forward generation time contracts around the peak of an epidemic. This contraction effect has previously been attributed to either competition among potential infectors or depletion of susceptibles in the population. The first explanation requires many infectives for contraction to occur whereas the latter explanation suggests that contraction occurs even when there are few infectives. With a simulation study we show that both competition and depletion cause the mean forward generation time to contract. Our results also reveal that the distribution of the infectious period and the reproduction number have a strong effect on the size and timing of the contraction, as well as on the mean value of the generation time in both forward and backward scheme. These observations relate to the 'serial interval', the time interval between symptom 26 onset of a secondary case and symptom onset of its infector [10]. Many authors have 27 used the serial interval as a synonym for the generation time. However, unlike the 28 generation time, the serial interval can have a negative duration when the clinical 29 March 5, 2019 2/23 .

" A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% 21 identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically 28 analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and 29 the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The 30 results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV 33 S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV 35 and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint 39 Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and 40 subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . 41 Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . The severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 1,3 . In the 45 meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4 . For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 47 (also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms 49 in Guangdong Province of China 5-10 . SADS-CoV is an α-coronavirus and other 50 representative members in the α-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 51 (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory 52 coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-53 229E) 1 . Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis 54 coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-55 OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the 56 γ-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the δ-genus 1 . 57 Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations 58 underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 3,11-13 .

" To compare the secondary structures of RNA molecules we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign is based on the combination of the Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS) algorithm to predict the RNA secondary structure at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method to align profiles of different lengths. We applied CROSSalign to investigate the structural conservation of long non-coding RNAs such as XIST and HOTAIR as well as ssRNA viruses including HIV. In a pool of sequences with the same secondary structure CROSSalign accurately recognizes repeat A of XIST and domain D2 of HOTAIR and outperforms other methods based on covariance modelling. CROSSalign can be applied to perform pair-wise comparisons and is able to find homologues between thousands of matches identifying the exact regions of similarity between profiles of different lengths. The algorithm is freely available at the webpage Sequence similarity is often considered the key feature to investigate evolutionary conservation of coding transcripts [1]. Yet, knowledge of secondary structure provides important insights into the biological function of RNAs by allowing the study of physical properties, such as for instance molecular interactions [2]. In most cases, information about the RNA folding complements sequence analysis [3] and is useful to understand mechanisms of action: microRNA precursors, for example, are processed by DGCR8 only if properly folded in hairpin loop structures [4]. Similarly, the architecture of ribosomal RNAs evolves in a self-contained way through conservation of stem loops present in ancient species [5,6], indicating distinct requirements for structural elements. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regarded as a mystery in terms of sequence and structural conservation [7]. The vast majority of lncRNAs evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologues [7,8]. Indeed, the average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs is 20% between human and mouse and drops to 5% between human and fish [7]. Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information to study lncRNA conservation and secondary structure could be used for better characterization. Similarly to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly [9], which indicates that secondary structure investigation could be key to revealing evolutionary properties. To study the structural conservation of two RNA molecules, we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign, available at our webpages http://service.tartaglialab.com//new_submission/crossalign, is based on the combination of two methods: 1) Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS), which is an algorithm trained on experimental data to predict RNA secondary structure profiles without sequence length restrictions and at singlenucleotide resolution [10]; 2) the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity of two profiles of different lengths [11].

Moreover, CROSS shows better performances than algorithms such as RNAstructure [13,14] and RNAfold [12] (respective correlations 0.71 and 0.47 with crystals; Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) . shows comparable correlations with structural distances calculated with either CROSS or crystallographic profiles (respectively: 0.80, 0.83, 0.38 with author/funder.

While CROSS and crystallographic profiles identify specific clusters of RNA molecules with low sequence identity and high structural similarity (colored in red, orange and green according to difference confidence thresholds; Figures 1C, 1D, 1E) , SHAPE data cannot be used to identify these structures. To further test the usefulness of CROSSalign, we compared its output with that of CMfinder [15]. CMfinder is a method to compute multiple sequence alignments that exploits structural motifs for ranking (Materials and Methods, Comparisons with CMfinder). We analyzed the largest multiple sequence alignments reported in the CMfinder test set (cobalamin, intron gp II, s box, lysine and histone 3) and used the minimal structural distance to assign the closest match to each transcript. Selecting equal-size groups (lowest and highest CMfinder scores), we measured CROSSalign performances on CMfinder rankings, achieving an AUC of 0.80 (Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Figure 5A). We note that CROSSalign has particularly strong performances on the largest dataset: cobalamin (71 sequences of 216nt; AUC of 0.95; Supplementary Figure 5B). Ribosomal RNAs are considered one of the most ancient, structured and conserved classes of RNA molecules [5]. The first step to validate CROSSalign was to search for structural similarities between the Small SubUnit (SSU) of the rRNA of different bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Deinococcus radiodurans). All the rRNAs show significant structural similarity (p-value <10 -5 ) with a low structural distance (~0.08; Table 1A ). By contrast, shuffling one of the two sequences in CROSSalign predictions results in non-significant scoring (p-values of 0.10 or higher; Table 1A ), indicating the importance of the sequence context in our calculations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are the most similar SSUs (structural distance of 0.06; p-value <10 -5 ). As the SSU of the rRNAs is thought to have evolved in a self-contained structure where the secondary structure of the ancient species is author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/284869 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 contained in the other ones [6], we searched the complete SSU of Escherichia coli in the SSU of other species such as Pyrococcus furiosus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The results show a strong and significant structural similarity, in agreement with the theory of self-contained evolution (Table 1B) . By contrast, comparison with randomized E. coli SSU or H. sapiens mRNA of the same length results in non-significant scores (p-values of 0.10 or higher Table 1B) . XIST is a lncRNA characterized by several repetitive domains showing different structural properties (Figures 2A and 2B) [16]. The 5' conserved region, named Arepeat (or RepA), is indispensable for gene-silencing and has been shown to be highly conserved in mammals. In mouse it consists of 7.5 copies (8.5 in humans) of 26-mers separated by U-rich linkers (Figure 2A) [17]. In 2015 and 2017, two reports on the XIST A-repeat structure were published [18,19], both making use of experimental techniques to infer XIST structure . The A-repeat structures obtained are similar with strikingly identical stem-loop structures, both emerging from larger RNA bulges of repeats 3, 5, and 6 (for a comparison with CROSS predictions, see our previous manuscript [10]). To evaluate the ability of CROSSalign to recognize the structural content in RepA, we used RNAinverse from Vienna suite [12] to generate 50 different sequences (average identity of 40%; Supplementary Table 1) with the same structure as RepA (Materials and Methods; Reverse engineering: from structure to sequence). The sequences were then divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set, and we built a list of negative cases by shuffling 25 times the original RepA. We then used CROSSalign to compute all scores for the positive and negative set against the corresponding reference set and used the minimal structural distance to assign the closest match to each transcript. The strong performances obtained highlight the ability of CROSSalign to identify structural similarities regardless of the sequence similarity (AUC of 0.85; Figure 2C ). As a further test of the usefulness of CROSSalign we compared the above results with those obtained using CMsearch from the Infernal-1.1.2 package, an algorithm based on author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/284869 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 a covariance model approach [20]. In this case, CMsearch is not able to identify any match between either the positive or negative list and the reference sets (AUC of 0.5; CROSSalign is able to recognize structural similarities between non-similar sequences, outperforming covariance-based approaches such as CMsearch. After this first validation step, we used CROSSalign to study structural similarities of XIST domain RepA in 10 different species [21]. Our analysis reveals that primates cluster close to human (Supplementary Figure 6A) while other species are more distant (Supplementary Figures 6A and 7) . By contrast, calculating sequence similarity with respect to human XIST (computed with EMBOSS; see Materials and Methods), we could not identify a specific cluster for primates (Supplementary Figure   6B ). Thus, our results indicate that secondary structure shows a higher degree of conservation than sequence. We then selected RepA of orangutan and searched for structural similarities within all human intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs 8176 sequences; ENSEMBLE 82). XIST was ranked as the best significant match in the pool (structural distance 0.01; p-value < 10 -6 ) and RepA was correctly identified (predicted coordinates: 328-764; 95% overlap with the query region; Figure 3A ; Supplementary Table 2) . Similar results were observed for baboon RepA (best result: 0.032; 86% overlap with the query region) and lemur RepA (best result: 0.075; p-value; 97% overlap with the query region), suggesting a strong structural conservation within primates ( Figure 3B ). By contrast, human and mouse RepA showed a larger distance in terms of both structural and sequence similarity, which is in agreement with previous studies on lncRNA conservation [22]. We used CROSSalign to search for the human RepA within all mouse lncRNAs and identified XIST as the 5 th best hit (structural distance 0.085; p-value < 10 -6 ; Figure 4A ). In this case, the position of RepA was not correctly assigned (coordinates: 10306-10698; 0% overlap) but the best match falls into the regulatory region of exon 7, and the structural relation between RepA and exon 7 has been reported [23]. Importantly, the correct coordinates of human RepA within mouse XIST rank second in our analysis (structural distance 0.086; p-value < 10 -6 ), while the best match is a miRNA-containing the gene Mirg (ENSMUSG00000097391) and the two secondary structure profiles author/funder.

Interestingly, even if little information is available on Mirg, the transcript is prevalently expressed in the embryo [24]. This result unveils a previously unreported relationship between XIST and Mirg, in which structural and functional homologies can be linked. Intriguingly, also the second best result, Rian (ENSMUSG00000097451), is expressed in embryo, while no information is available on the third and fourth hits (ENSMUSG00000107391 and ENSMUSG00000085312). We note that the five matches here are not listed in the top 20 hits obtained by analysis of sequence similarity (<34%). Our results suggest that the secondary structure of RepA is conserved among primates, and diverges between human and mouse. However, analyzing the information contained in structured nucleotides (i.e., nucleotides with CROSS score < 0 are set to 0) we could identify XIST as the best match of human RepA within all mouse lncRNAs (structural distance 0.034; p-value < 10 -6 ; Figure 4C ). This result indicates that double-stranded regions are more conserved than single-stranded regions. In addition, we note that by sequence identity, XIST ranks as the 14 th hit of human RepA in all mouse lncRNAs, which indicates that methods based on sequence comparison show a significantly lower ability to identify structural homologues. HOTAIR shows a complex secondary structure, divided into four domains (D1, 2, 3, 4; Figures 5A and 5B) [25]. Experimentally it has been determined that more than 50% of the nucleotides are involved in base pairing (CROSS achieves an AUC > 0.80 in predicting its SHAPE profile; Supplementary Figures 8A and 8B) [26]. The region D2 is highly structured and consists of 15 helices, 11 terminal loops, and 4 junctions (three 5-way junctions and one 3-way junction) [26]. The D2 domain of HOTAIR is predicted by CROSS to be the most structured ( Figure   5B ). We used the same reverse engineering process as for RepA to generate 50 different sequences (average identity of 40%; Supplementary Table 1) with the same secondary structure as D2 (Materials and Methods; Reverse engineering: from structure to sequence). Also in this case, CROSSalign reports good performances (AUC of 0.72; Figure 5C ) that are superior to those obtained using the covariance-author/funder. All rights reserved.

" is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, underexpression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Fitness is a complex parameter often used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists to quantitatively describe the reproductive ability and evolutionary potential of an organism into a particular environment 1,2 . Despite this apparently simple definition, measuring fitness is difficult and most studies only measure one or more fitness components (e.g., survival to maturity, fecundity, number of mates, or number of offspring produced) as proxies to total fitness 1,2 . In the field of virology, it has become standard to measure fitness by growth-competition experiments in mixed infections with a reference strain 3,4 . With this experimental set up, fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when the available resources have to be shared with a competitor 5 . Regardless its limitations, at least, this approach provides a metric for ranking viral strains according to their performance in a particular environment/host. Such a fitness measure has been pivotal for quantitatively understanding many virus evolution processes: the effect of genetic bottlenecks and accumulation of deleterious mutations in RNA virus populations 6-8 , the rates and dynamics of adaptive evolution into novel hosts 9, , the pleiotropic cost of host range expansion 10-12 , the cost of genome complexity 13,14 , the cost of antiviral escape mutations 15-17 , the topography of adaptive fitness landscapes 18-20 , and the role of robustness in virus evolution 21-23 . But differences in viral fitness should also matter in genome wide studies seeking to understand the mode of action of the viruses (i.e., the precise way they interact with their hosts). Even though it has been argued that an integrative systems biology approach to viral pathogenesis would result in a better understanding of pathogenesis and in the identification of common targets for different viruses, therefore serving as a guide to a more rational design of therapeutic drugs 24-30 , pioneering studies have ignored the high genetic variability of viruses and subsequent differences in fitness and in mode of action. Experimental evidences support that even single nucleotide substitutions have significant effects on viral fitness, regardless they are synonymous or nonsynonymous, or they affect coding or non-coding genomic regions 31-37 . A common trend among all these studies is that, whenever fitness is evaluated in the standard host, the distribution of mutational effects is highly skewed towards deleterious effects, with a large fraction of mutations being lethal. Furthermore, increasing evidences suggest that the shape and location of the distribution of fitness effects depends on the host species, being the difference among two hosts (e.g., a tested host and the natural one) greater as their genetic divergence increases 12, 20, 38, 39 . Together, all these observations suggest that the fitness of a given viral genotype depends not only on its own genetic background, but also on the host where fitness is evaluated. Arguably, differences in viral fitness reflect differences in the virus-host interaction, with respect to a reference strain. As the cellular parasites they are, viruses need to kidnap all sort of cellular factors and resources, reprogram gene expression patterns into their own benefit, and block and interfere with cellular defenses. And all these processes take place embedded into the host complex network of intertwined interactions and regulations.

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Results: All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years.

" Urodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects. However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [∆HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with αchloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.",Title: Anesthetic agents affect urodynamic parameters and anesthetic depth at doses necessary to facilitate preclinical testing in felines
" Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or 28 direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find 44 that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic 45 diversity. 46 47 3 mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural 53 selection, we asked why hasn't the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used 54 experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may 55 actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral 56 mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but 58 because it is hard to be both fast and accurate. 59 60 Introduction 61 Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, and mutation rates can have a significant 62 impact on evolutionary rate [1-3]. The intraspecific variability in mutation rate in many viruses 63 and bacteria indicates that mutation rates have been optimized by natural selection [4-13]. Given that most mutations are deleterious, the burden of excess mutational load will select 65 against strains with abnormally high mutation rates [14][15][16][17]. This principle led to Sturtevant to 66 ask, ""Why does the mutation rate not evolve to zero?"" [18,19]. A large body of theoretical and experimental work suggests that the selective pressure for 69 higher mutation rates is due to either the physicochemical cost of maintaining a lower one or a 70 selective advantage from an increased supply of beneficial mutations [20-23]. Many have 71 argued for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates in pathogenic microbes, which often exist 72 in dynamic environments and are subject to host immune pressure [7,24,25]. However, direct 73 selection of a variant with a higher mutation rate will only occur if it has been advantageous in 74 the past, and in many cases, it has been difficult to separate the causes of a higher mutation 75 rate from its consequences [19,26]. 76 77 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/309880 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 RNA viruses are ideal systems for studying the selective forces that act on mutation rates. While 78 interspecific mutation rates range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 errors per nucleotide copied [4], studies of 79 antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several fold within a 80 species [27]. The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on 81 mutation rates and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9,28-31]. Given the short 82 generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher 83 fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32,33]. However, the observed 84 attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of 85 high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus' evolution in the 86 face of varying intrahost environments [7,10,34-38]. This concept is central to viral quasispecies 87 theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24,25]. Here, we define the selective forces that shape viral mutation rates by studying an antimutator 90 variant. The 3D G64S mutant of poliovirus was selected after serial passage in ribavirin, an RNA 91 virus mutagen. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 3D) of this variant contains a 92 single glycine to serine substitution [5-7]. The basal mutation rate of 3D G64S is reported to be 93 ~20-30% that of wild type virus (WT). While the 3D G64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus 94 receptor transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this 95 phenotype is not clear [7,36]. Biochemical assays of 3D G64S suggest a physicochemical cost of 96 high fidelity, but as in other systems, its contribution to overall fitness remains unquantified 97 [6,19,39]. 99 Results We measured the relative fitness of 3D G64S by direct competition over serial passage by RT-101 qPCR (Fig. 1A) . Here, the fitness of 3D G64S is 0.78 ± 0.01 (n=3 replicates) relative to WT. This is 102 a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64 th percentile in a dataset of 8970 fitness values 103 .

We also measured the relative growth properties 105 of WT and 3D G64S using a plaque size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and 106 spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40][41][42]. The distribution of clonal 107 plaque sizes was significantly different (p<0.005, unpaired t-test with Welch correction, n=272 108 WT and n=220 3D G64S plaques), and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3D G64S (Fig.   109 1C). In contrast to prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3D G64S by 110 one step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and 111 larger numbers of replicates (Fig. 1D ). This replication defect was not specific to HeLa, as we 112 observed a similar lag for 3D G64S in a 3T3 cell line that we derived from mouse embryonic 113 fibroblasts from poliovirus receptor transgenic mice (PVR-3T3, Fig. 1E ). These data 114 demonstrate that the fitness defect of 3D G64S is largely attributable to its slower replicative 115 kinetics and is consistent with biochemical assays on purified RdRp [6,39]. The reduced mutation rate and replicative fitness of 3D G64S suggest a trade-off between speed 118 and fidelity in RNA virus replication. Here, the fitness gain from increased replicative speed is 119 offset by a reduction in fitness due to increased mutational load. We derived a quantitative 120 model of this trade-off (see SI Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness (Fig. 1F ) and 121 mutation rate (Fig. 1G, Table S1 ) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, 122 ribavirin [43]. Wild type and 3D G64S had equal fitness at approximately 150µM ribavirin. Based 123 on these data, our model indicates that WT incurs a fitness cost of 0.137 from mutational load 124 alone. Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would 125 presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037. If viral RdRp are constrained by a speed-fidelity trade-off, selection for increased replicative 128 speed (r-selection) will increase mutation rate.

" Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.",Adaptive Estimation for Epidemic Renewal and Phylogenetic Skyline Models
" In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindrome small RNAs 26 (cpsRNAs) and proposed cpsRNAs and palindrome small RNAs (psRNAs) as a novel class of small RNAs. 27 The first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named SARS-28 CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Further 29 sequence analysis supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 originated from bat betacoronavirus. The results of 30 RNAi experiments showed that one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 significantly induced cell 31 apoptosis. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or 32 pathogenicity. The discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs paved the way to find new markers for pathogen 33 detection and reveal the mechanisms in the infection or pathogenicity from a different point of view. The 34 discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs also broaden the understanding of palindrome motifs in animal of plant 35 genomes.",Complemented palindrome small RNAs first discovered from SARS coronavirus
" Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the ""coronavirus"" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information.

" To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 . DESIGN Retrospective case series Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 All rights reserved.

" The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain nearequipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the aketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. We chose the chemical class of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides to assess the feasibility of achieving antiviral drugs targeting coronaviruses and enteroviruses with near-equipotency. Here we describe the structure-based design, synthesis, and evaluation of inhibitory activity of a series of compounds with broad-spectrum activities afforded by studying the structure-activity relationships mainly with respect to the P2 position of the peptidomimetics. One of the compounds designed and synthesized exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV. RESULTS Our efforts to design novel a-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus M pro s and enterovirus 3C pro s started with a detailed analysis of the following crystal structures of unliganded target enzymes: SARS-CoV M pro (ref. 25-27; PDB entries 1UJ1, 2BX3, 2BX4); bat coronavirus HKU4 M pro as a surrogate for the closely related MERS-CoV protease (our unpublished work (Ma, Xiao et al.; PDB entry 2YNA; see also ref. 27); HCoV-229E M pro (ref. 27,28; PDB entry: 1P9S); Coxsackievirus B3 3C pro (our unpublished work; Tan et al., PDB entry 3ZYD); enterovirus D68 3C pro (ref. 29; PDB entry: 3ZV8); and enterovirus A71 3C pro (ref. 30; PDB entry: 3SJK). During the course of the present study, we determined crystal structures of a number of lead a-ketoamide compounds in complex with SARS-CoV M pro , HCoV-NL63 M pro , and CVB3 3C pro , in support of the design of improvements in the next round of lead optimization. Notably, unexpected differences between alpha-and betacoronavirus M pro were found in this study. The structural foundation of these was elucidated in detail in a subproject involving the M pro of HCoV NL63; because of its volume, this work will be published separately (Zhang et al., in preparation) and only some selected findings are referred to here. The main protease of the newly discovered coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak of respiratory illness is 96% identical (98% similar) in amino-acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV M pro (derived from the RNA genome of BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Genbank accession code: MN908947.2; http://virological.org/t/initialgenome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last accessed on January 11, 2020), so all results reported here for inhibition of SARS-CoV will most likely also apply to the new virus.","Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure-based design, synthesis, and activity assessment"
" 25 26 27 INTRODUCTION: Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide 28 actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies 29 were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how 30 timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: 31 To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease 32 outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the 33 recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey 34 literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or 35 epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 36 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, 37 reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were 38 identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R 0 (basic reproductive number) 39 and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-40 Barré Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most 41 studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific 42 studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most 43 common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 44 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent 45 in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty 46 percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 47 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail 48 allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the 49 epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV 50 predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 51 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 52 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in 53 these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for 54 improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to 55 improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and 56 pandemics. 57 58 Author summary: Researchers published many studies which sought to predict and forecast 59 important features of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and their spread during the 2016-2017 ZIKV 60 pandemic. We conducted a comprehensive review of such ZIKV prediction studies and 61 evaluated their aims, the data sources they used, which methods were used, how timely they 62 were published, and whether they provided sufficient information to be used or reproduced by 63 others. Of the 73 studies evaluated, we found that the accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, 64 and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there 65 is substantial room for improvement. We identified that the release of study findings before 66 formal journal publication ('pre-prints') increased the timeliness of Zika prediction studies, but",2 A systematic review and evaluation of Zika virus forecasting and prediction research during a 3 public health emergency of international concern 4 5 Kobres P

" A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease 20 in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis. By using genomic, sequence, 21 structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha-and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families 22 of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses 23 and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly 24 evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its 25 predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses 26 which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig 27 domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by 28 viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the 29 immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts. 30 31",Novel Immunoglobulin Domain Proteins Provide Insights into Evolution and Pathogenesis Mechanisms of SARS-Related Coronaviruses
" Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV. We identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-nCoV and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates.",Title: Candidate targets for immune responses to 2019-Novel Coronavirus (nCoV): sequence homology-and bioinformatic-based predictions
" Single particle cryo-EM is a powerful method for studying proteins and other biological macromolecules. Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over-and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.",Non-uniform refinement: Adaptive regularization improves single particle cryo-EM reconstruction

" Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans has been associated with congenital malformations and other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of twenty-four women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these thirdtrimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.","ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION AT DIFFERENT PREGNANCY STAGES: ANATOMOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TARGET CELLS AND VIRAL PERSISTENCE IN PLACENTAL TISSUES Running title ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION IN HUMAN PLACENTAS List of authors"
" Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This 20 study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to 21 assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial 22 bronchitis. 23 Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with 24 persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent 25 bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene 26 quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene 27 sequencing. 28 No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R 2 = 0.01, P = 29 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind 30 brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important 31 implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. 32 A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community 33 composition (R 2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients.

" In the analysis of genomic sequence data, so-called ""alignment free"" approaches are often 12 selected for their relative speed compared to alignment-based approaches, especially in the 13 application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification 1,2,3,4 . These methods are 14 typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers 5 . In 15 the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in 16 applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for 17 antimicrobial resistance genes 6,7,8 . This can be seen as an analogy of the ""bag-of-words"" 18 model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for 19 document and image classification 9,10 . Feature extraction techniques from natural language 20 processing have previously been analogized to genomics data 11 ; however, the ""bag-of-21 words"" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance 22 and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of ""bag-of-23 words"" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus 24 space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects 25 an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the 26 construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative 'degenerate' K-27 mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary 28 phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying 29 nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA 30 virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, 31 hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-32 host vs. non-human host in Influenza A.

" Background: GenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. Results: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of ""alerts"" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank's submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. Conclusion: VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allows researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.",VADR: validation and annotation of virus sequence submissions to GenBank
" Social experiences are an important predictor of disease susceptibility and survival in humans and other social mammals. Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.",Social history and exposure to pathogen signals modulate social status effects on gene regulation in rhesus macaques

" The virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans, and still posed a serious threat to the global public health. The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete. Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics. However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential. This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences. This work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies.",Identification of viruses with the potential to infect human
" Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.",Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data
" We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.",Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China
" 1 To explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control 2 continuous COVID-19 spread.

We show that the structures of networks describing who infects whom and who is protected from whom are modular and weighted-nested, respectively. The dynamic interplay between these networks influences transitions between dynamical regimes of virus diversification and host control,leading to eventual virus extinction. The three empirical systems exhibit weighted nestedness, a pattern our theory shows is indicative of viral control by hosts. Previously missing from studies of microbial host-pathogen systems, the protection network plays a key role in the coevolutionary dynamics. The structure of complex ecological communities is clearly non-random. It is generally argued that interaction structure affects the stability of communities to perturbations [1-3] and arises from coevolutionary dynamics between interacting partners [4] [5] [6] [7] , yet the structure-dynamics nexus remains a long-standing central question in community and network ecology. Host-parasite infection networks, in which interaction structure represents 'who infects whom', have been typically described as modular, nested, or both [8, 9] . Modularity concerns patterns of specificity, in which the network is partitioned into modules of hosts and parasites that interact densely with each other but sparsely with those outside the group. Nestedness concerns instead patterns of specialization, and describes a network structure in which specialist hosts are infected by subsets of parasites that in turn also infect the more generalist hosts [8, 9] . Common to all host-parasite network studies is a dominant focus on patterns of infection. Infection structure should critically depend however on the genetic basis of resistance of hosts to pathogens [10] . The emergence of network structure from immune selection has been shown in pathogens of humans such as Plasmodium falciparum [11, 12]. In particular, strain theory developed for pathogens with multilocus encoding of antigens posits that negative frequency dependent selection, mediated by competition for hosts through cross-immunity, can structure pathogen populations into clusters of strains with limited overlap of antigenic repertoires [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Parasites with 2 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a resistance by surface mutation can arise quickly to take over CRISPR or restriction-modification systems in providing immunity. This experimental and theoretical evidence for advantages of surface modification may entail strong fitness costs under natural conditions because mutations in surface receptors such as those in flagella or pili can be detrimental for microbial movement and biofilm formation [21] . Investigations of natural populations have indeed shown that surface resistance is costly in the wild [27, 28] . These observations underlie the need for complementing experimental approaches by developing theory on the kinds of 'macroscopic', whole system, diversity patterns expected under 'microscopic' CRISPR-induced coevolutionary processes. These patterns can serve as signatures in both nature and experiments for inferring whether specific underlying processes of resistance are at play. Resistance mechanisms can operate alone or in tandem to affect the diversification of microbes and phages. Nonetheless, not all of these are relevant for linking between host/phage genotypes and immune phenotype as observed in the structure of immunity and infection networks. Surface modification, for instance, is a result of mutation and selection that will provide advantage to one or few mutated strains periodically sweeping through the population. Restriction-modification systems, being unspecific to viral genetic sequence, also do not provide such link because they do not result in the creation of new strains. In contrast, CRISPR is a heritable adaptive immune system conferring sequence-specific protection against viruses, plasmids, and other mobile elements [23, 29] . As such, it not only provides a direct sequence-based link, but also allows consideration of concomitant structures for both infection and immunity, and from both host and parasite perspectives. The diversity of CRISPR alleles in natural, experimental and simulated populations has been explored [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . It has been shown, for example, that increased strain diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with strains being clones with different spacer compositions) promotes the ability of the bacterium to control the DMS3vir virus [32] . Nevertheless, how such strain diversity evolves, the emergence of structure of host-virus interaction networks, and how they are assembled and disassembled remain unexplored. Advancing this predictive framework for CRISPR-Cas in microbial populations provides a basis for further study of the relative importance and interactions of different resistance mechanisms, and is essential for effective experimental manipulation of microbial systems, including applications to health and engineering [35, 36] . It can open new frontiers in studies of immune diversity and, more generally, contribute to tighten the connection between microbiology and evolutionary biology [37] .",The network structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics of CRISPR-induced immune diversification
" Enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fusing with cellular membranes, a step required for virus replication. Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.",Coronavirus S protein-induced fusion is blocked prior to hemifusion by Abl kinase inhibitors
" Compound heterozygotes occur when different mutations at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of mutations at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 genomes participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 genomes data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 genomes participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5% and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous mutations in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development -PRTG (p=0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p=0.0221% MAF, combined ancestries), and MACF1 (p=0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous mutations should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.",In trans variant calling reveals enrichment for compound heterozygous variants in genes involved in neuronal development and growth
" The Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R 0 . Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.",
" Background: Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. Purpose: To summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of NCIP cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality cases. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. Results: 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years . 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. Conclusions: 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.","Association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China"
" An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","Transmission potential of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) onboard the Diamond Princess Cruises Ship, 2020"
" 26 The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its 27 control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its 28 classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now 29 recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical 30 consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common 31 origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two 32 genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population 33 dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A 34 collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences 35 of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected 36 in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results 37 demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist 38 until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the 39 main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely 40 through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated 41 in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains 42 originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to 43 Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. 44 Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate 45 from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and 46 sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be 47 shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general. Introduction 52 Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is currently classified in the species Avian coronavirus, genus 53 Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. The viral genome is about 27 Kb 54 long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 55 numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid 56 structural proteins [1]. IBV currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry 57 farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, 58 particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections [2]. Similarly to other 59 RNA viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the 60 rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity [3]. 61 The Spike protein, further processed in the S1 and S2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral 62 protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. Besides being involved in 63 viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing 64 immune response [1,4]. Its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one 65 being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes [5], which severely 66 hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. Additionally, the genetic variability 67 has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes 68 based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. Although it 69 could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding 70 or confusing the proper understanding of IBV molecular epidemiology. 71 Only in 2016, in the framework of COST Action FA1207, a coherent and common IBV genotype 72 classification was proposed [6], grouping the identified strains in 6 genotypes and 32 lineages. 73 Interestingly, Valastro et al., (2016), confirmed what previously proposed by Franzo et al., [7] about 74 the clustering of 624/I and Q1 genotypes in the same group (currently named GI-16). 75 Until then, the two genotypes had been named (and considered) independent: the 624/I was first 76 reported in Italy in 1993 [8], and thereafter in Slovenia [9], Poland [10], and Russia [11]. Moreover, doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 77 retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in Italy since the early 1960s [12], where it 78 remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. However, from the 1990s, its 79 detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. At the same time, in 1996, a new virus (later 80 renamed Q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis [13] in China and thereafter in 81 other Asian [14,15], Middle Eastern [16,17], South American [18,19] and European countries 82 [7,20-22]. Remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spreading 83 from Asia was supposed, similarly to what proven for the GI-19 lineage (QX genotype) [23]. The 84 insight provided by recent genetic studies [6,7] raised new questions about the history, 85 epidemiology and spreading of the GI-16 lineage around the world. The knowledge of these 86 processes would be of interest not only for the particular case under investigation, but could also 87 provide useful information on the general intra-and inter-continents viral dispersion patterns, aiding 88 the development and implementation of adequate control measures. 89 Unfortunately, the paucity of sequences available before Q1 detection in China prevented this 90 investigation for a long time. In the present study, a high number of retrospective GI-16 sequences 91 were generated from Italian samples collected since 1963 and analyzed together with the worldwide 92 available ones using a phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the history of this genotype and infer 93 its spreading pattern around the world. 94 95 Material and Methods 96 Italian strain detection and sequencing 97 IBV samples collected between 1963-2017 were included in the study. Italian sequences were 98 obtained during the routine diagnostic activity of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della 99 Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna.

The sequencing of 104 samples collected before 2009 was performed on the isolates whereas the sequencing of those 105 collected after 2009 was directly carried outon the submitted tissues. . 106 . Viral RNA was extracted from isolates using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 107 according to the manufacturer's protocol. IBV was detected using RT-PCR as previously described 108 [23]. Partial sequencing of the S1 gene (464-bp), covering the hypervariable region 3 (HVR3), was 109 performed using the same primers that were used for RT-PCR. The obtained chromatogram quality 110 was evaluated by FinchTV (http://www.geospiza.com) and the consensus sequences were 111 reconstructed using CromasPro (CromasPro Version 1.5). 112 113 International database preparation 114 To download all available IBV sequences overlapping with the region of interest (HVR3), one of 115 the Italian sequences was used as query in BLAST and all sequences with a genetic distance lower 116 than 30% were downloaded. Obtained sequences plus the Italian ones were merged with the 117 reference set provided by Valastro et al., [6] and aligned using MAFFT [24]. Partial sequences (i.e. 118 covering only part of the HVR3) and those with unknown nucleotides, frameshift mutations and 119 premature stop codons, suggestive of poor sequence quality, were removed from the dataset. 120 A phylogenetic tree was then reconstructed using PhyML [25] selecting as the most appropriate 121 substitution model the one with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) calculated using 122 Jmodeltest [26]. The phylogenetic tree was used to classify the strains and those 123 potentially belonging to the GI-16 lineage were extracted. The presence of 124 recombinant strains was evaluated using RDP4 [27] on a dataset including the selected GI-16 like 125 strains plus the reference ones. The RDP4 settings for each method were adjusted accounting for the 126 dataset features according to the RDP manual recommendations.

After recombinant removal, the absence of residual 129 breakpoints was confirmed with SBP implemented in HyPhy [28]. Only sequences with collection 130 date and country were included in the study. Dedicated Python scripts were used to extract this 131 information from the Genbank file or, if absent, original publications were consulted and the 132 sequences were re-named accordingly. Finally, TempEst [29] was used to investigate the 'temporal 133 signal' of the heterochronous sequences under investigation and the sequences whose sampling date 134 was inconsistent with their genetic divergence and phylogenetic position were removed. Indeed, 135 significant deviations from the expectation can be due to several factors including low sequencing 136 quality, excessive passaging leading to the accumulation of cell-line adaptations, recombination, 137 etc. [29]. Xia test was performed for each codon position to exclude the presence of codon 138 saturation. 139 140 Phylodynamic analysis 141 Since there was a clear bias in the number of sequences collected in each county and in different 142 time periods, the original dataset was split in ten randomly generated databases in order to diminish 143 this bias impact and evaluate the robustness of achieved results over several independent runs [30]. 144 More specifically, a maximum of 5 sequences for each country-year pair were randomly selected 145 and included in the study. For each dataset the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA), 146 the evolutionary rates (substitutions/sites/year) and population dynamics (expressed as Effective 147 population size (Ne)•generation time (t), also called relative genetic diversity) were jointly 148 estimated in a Bayesian fashion using the serial coalescent approach implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 149 [31]. Additionally, the discrete state phylogeographic approach implemented in the same program 150 was used to reconstruct the viral spreading pattern, assuming each collection country as a strain 151 feature [32]. This method allows to estimate the location and time of ancestral strains, calibrated 152 using the implemented molecular clock and population model. Above all, the Bayesian approach 153 allows to account for all the other parameter and phylogenetic uncertainness. Additionally, the use . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

In the latter phase, two main peaks in the mean Ne•t value were consistently 208 predicted around ~1985 and ~2005-2008. An additional minor rise was detected after 2010. 209 Nevertheless, the variation in the population size slightly differed among runs and, more generally, 210 the 95HPD intervals were generally broad over the whole considered period. 211 212 Figure 2.

" The ecological success of social insects is based on division of labour, not only between queens 20 and workers, but also among workers.

" Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. In the present study, we employed multiple codon usage analysis indices to determine genotype specific codon usage patterns of Zika virus (ZIKV) strains from the current outbreak and those reported previously. Several genotype specific and common codon usage traits were noted in ZIKV coding sequences, indicative of independent evolutionary origins from a common ancestor. The overall influence of natural selection was found to be more profound than that of mutation pressure and acting on specific set of viral genes belonging to ZIKV strains of Asian genotype from the recent outbreak. Furthermore, an interplay of codon adaptation and deoptimization have been observed in ZIKV genomes. The collective findings of codon analysis in association with the geographical data of Aedes populations in the Americas suggests that ZIKV have evolved a dynamic set of codon usage patterns in order to maintain a successful replication and transmission chain within multiple hosts and vectors.",Zika virus outbreak in the Americas: Is Aedes albopictus an overlooked culprit?
" Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns.

" During its first month, the recently emerged 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already infected many thousands of people in mainland China and worldwide and took hundreds of lives. However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus.

" Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune function. Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3 + T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4 + T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8 + T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4 + / CD8 + inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.",Analysis on the Clinical Characteristics of 36 Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Kunming

" Objective: Health system resilience and resilience of a country include the capacity of health personnel, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises. This study investigates the knowledge and attitudes of the public concerning Ebola Virus Disease in Trinidad and Tobago. Design and Methods: A cross sectional study whereby respondents (n = 920) were sampled from public places. Data were collected via interviewer administered questionnaires. Data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Results: The response rate was 67.6 % (622/920). The main age category of responders was the 20 to 30 year age category (40.5%); responders were mostly female (58.0 %). Regarding knowledge, there were significant differences among occupational categories (F = 2.811, df1 = 6, df2 = 571, p-value = 0.011). Tukey's HSD post hoc test revealed that the mean knowledge scores for professional and sales occupations differed significantly (p-value = 0.003). There was a significant association between being afraid to go for treatment and age (p-value = 0.001). Significant associations were also found between occupational grouping and education attainment with opinion about the preparedness of private medical facilities, likelihood to shun family members with Ebola, being afraid to go for treatment and preference for traditional medicine (p-value <0.05).

" The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.

" The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic 10 categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, 11 subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to 12 designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed 13 standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been 14 proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are 15 divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation 16 of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the 17 most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular 18 epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus 19 sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our 20 phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated 21 holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters 22 between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate 23 sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus 24 propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of 25 subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a 26 method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. 27 author/funder.

" Since December 2019, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread from Wuhan, China to the world, it has caused more than 87,000 diagnosed cases and more than 3,000 deaths globally. To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. CoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.",Viral Architecture of SARS-CoV-2 with Post-Fusion Spike Revealed by Cryo-EM
" With the emergence of 4 rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. . Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions. The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.",Caution: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients at admission are changing

However, many protein 15 sequences escape, at least partially, domain annotation, particularly in non-model organisms and remain 16 in the so-called dark protein sequence universe [4] . Classical methodological approaches model protein 17 domain families as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). However, to that aim, sequences need to be clustered 18 and aligned based on the identification of sequence similarities. Therefore, proteins from organisms distant 19 from the species considered in the model, fast diverging proteins, recently emerged domains and domains 20 containing disordered regions, are less likely to be annotated using this methodology [5].

" Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case-fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-2.23; p = 0.87; I 2 = 35%). We also found non-significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions.

" The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified. The 2019-nCoV outbreak is a global health risk, especially considering the number of patients who have already died after becoming infected in Wuhan, China. Many initial characterizations of the virus have focused on the basic reproduction number, R , which reflects the average number of infections that each new infection causes in a susceptible population. Whenever R is greater than one, epidemic transition becomes possible and within the Wuhan province, R has been estimated as high as 4.1 1-3 .",Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States
" Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 . Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. : medRxiv preprint 5 malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.

" 26 Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-27 related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize 28 MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of 29 MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 45 prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin. 46 47 All rights reserved.

" Note: this report is a pre-print and has not yet been peer-reviewed. As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available. As of 29 Jan 2019, 5,997 confirmed and 9,239 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported from China with 132 deaths confirmed so far 1 . There were cases in at least 15 other countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China 2 . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3 it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak. Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5 , airport screening is frequently implemented to limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries. Here we use the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers with 2019-nCoV.

" The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection.

" Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.",Cotranslational Folding Stimulates Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in the Alphavirus Structural Polyprotein
" Heterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread and, when not accounted for, can 12 produce unpredictable outbreaks of infectious disease. Despite this, precisely how 13 different sources of variation in host traits drive heterogeneity in disease transmission is 14 poorly understood. Here we dissected the sources of variation in pathogen transmission 15 using Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C Virus as a host-pathogen model 16 system. We found that infected lifespan, viral growth, virus shedding, and viral load at 17 death were all significantly influenced by fly genetic background, sex and female mating 18 status. To understand how variation in each of these traits may generate heterogeneity 19 in disease transmission, we estimated individual transmission potential by integrating 20 data on virus shedding and lifespan alongside previously collected data on social 21 aggregation. We found that ~15% of between-individual heterogeneity in disease 22 transmission was explained by a significant interaction between genetic and sex-specific 23 variation. We also characterised the amount of variation in viral load, virus shedding, and 24 lifespan following infection that could be explained by genetic background and sex. 25 Amongst the determinants of individual variation in disease transmission these sources 26 of host variation play roles of varying importance, with genetic background generally 27 playing the largest role. Our results highlight the importance of characterising sources of 28 variation in multiple host traits when studying disease transmission at the individual-level. 29 30",Dissecting genetic and sex-specific host heterogeneity in pathogen transmission 1 potential 2 3 4
" Viral detection is critical for controlling disease spread and progression. Recent emerging threats including the Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. In low-resource areas, a key obstacle is quick and accurate detection of viruses near the point of care. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal preamplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with ~24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.",Programmable low-cost DNA-based platform for viral RNA detection
" A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus. Severe infection by 2019-nCoV could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 2% of infected individuals 1 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of 2019-nCoV can bind the surface receptors of sensitive cells, and mediate the virus to enter into target cells. Recently, Xu et.al. modeled the spike protein and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this 2019-nCoV 2 . Zhou et. al. showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 3 . These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCov.","Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue"
" China reported zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-9 temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and 10 imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is 11 particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using 12 a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, 13 we jointly estimate the case reproduction number, , and the number of unobserved sources of 14 infection. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how 15 transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of 16 resurgence. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely 17 to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 18 projected for the year 2019, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.",Tracking progress towards malaria elimination in China: estimates of 1 reproduction numbers and their spatiotemporal variation 2 3
" For decades, cationic polymer nanoparticles have been investigated for nucleic acid delivery. Despite promising in vitro transfection results, most formulations have failed to translate into the clinic due to significant in vivo toxicity -especially when delivered intravenously. To address this significant problem, we investigated the detailed mechanisms that govern the complex in vivo systemic toxicity response to common polymeric nanoparticles. We determined that the toxicity response is material dependent. For branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) nanoparticles -toxicity is a function of multiple pathophysiological responses -triggering of innate immune sensors, induction of hepatic toxicity, and significant alteration of hematological properties. In contrast, for chitosan-based nanoparticles -systemic toxicity is primarily driven through innate immune activation. We further identified that modification of primary amines to secondary and tertiary amines using the small molecule imidazole-aceticacid (IAA) ameliorates in vivo toxicity from both nanocarriers by different, material-specific mechanisms related to Toll-like receptor 4 activation (for bPEI) and complement activation driven neutrophil infiltration (for chitosan), respectively. Our results provide a detailed roadmap for evaluating in vivo toxicity of nanocarriers and identifies potential opportunities to reduce toxicity for eventual clinical translation.",Modification of primary amines to higher order amines reduces in vivo hematological and immunotoxicity of cationic nanocarriers through TLR4 and complement pathways
" Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.",Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on the early global spread of COVID-19
" Bats are reservoirs for a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFNα in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.",The IFN response in bat cells consists of canonical and non-canonical ISGs with unique temporal expression kinetics
" Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China -where the outbreak started -seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. .

" Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus 27 on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44 Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after 45 disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at 46 equilibria. Our modelling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to 47 predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.",Individual and temporal variation in pathogen load predicts long- 1 term impacts of an emerging infectious disease
" ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins represent a diverse family of proteins that share ATPase domains that are adapted to regulate protein-DNA interactions. Here we present structures of the yeast Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.",Structure of the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1 bound to a ubiquitinylated nucleosome

" During outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV) and bioterror threats (e.g., smallpox), actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity. Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City's Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at ""low (but not zero) risk"" and ""some",Quantifying the Risk and Cost of Active Monitoring for Infectious Diseases

" The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.",Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)
" Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty-natural, or otherwise -to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as 'breakpoints' in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a 'stochastic breakpoint' where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the 'interruption of transmission' independent of the 'breakpoint' concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the 'fade-out' or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described. : medRxiv preprint Following past publications [12, 23] , the STH transmission model we introduce here is a stochastic individual-based analogue to the deterministic original given in Refs.

" Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2) days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89 days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65, 2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.",Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19
" An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for health-care capacity planning.",A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing
" Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. Conclusions.

" RNA degradation by RNase L during 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) is a conserved mammalian stress response to viral and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 2-5AMD onsets rapidly and facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to production of interferons (IFNs). To understand the mechanism of this protein synthesis reprogramming, we examined 2-5AMD in human cells. 2-5AMD triggers polysome collapse characteristic of a translation initiation defect, but translation initiation complexes and ribosomes purified from the translation-arrested cells remain functional. Using spike-in RNA-seq we found that basal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) rapidly decay, while mRNAs encoding IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes evade 2-5AMD and accumulate. The IFN evasion results from the combined effect of better mRNA stability and positive feedback amplification in the IFN response. Therefore, 2-5AMD and transcription act in concert to revamp the cellular mRNA composition. The resulting preferential accumulation of innate immune mRNAs establishes ""prioritized"" synthesis of defense proteins.",Concerted 2-5A-Mediated mRNA Decay and Transcription Reprogram Protein Synthesis in dsRNA Response
" Since 2007, repeated outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) has affected millions of people worldwide and created global health concern with major complications like microcephaly and Guillain Barre's syndrome. Generally, ZIKV transmits through mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) like other flaviviruses, but reports show blood transfusion and sexual mode of ZIKV transmission which further makes the situation alarming. Till date, there is not a single Zika specific licensed drug or vaccine present in the market. However, in recent months, several antiviral molecules have been screened against viral and host proteins. Among those, (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol has shown great virucidal potential against flaviviruses including ZIKV. However, the mechanistic understanding of EGCG targeting viral proteins is not yet entirely deciphered except little is known about its interaction with viral envelope protein and viral protease. Since literature has shown significant inhibitory interactions of EGCG against various kinases and bacterial DNA gyrases; we designed our study to find inhibitory actions of EGCG against ZIKV NS3 helicase. NS3 helicase is playing a significant role in viral replication by unwinding RNA after hydrolyzing NTP. We employed molecular docking and simulation approach and found significant interactions at ATPase site and also at RNA binding site. Further, the enzymatic assay has shown significant inhibition of NTPase activity with an IC50 value of 295.7 nM and Ki of 0.387 ± 0.034 µM. Our study suggests the possibility that EGCG could be considered as prime backbone molecule for further broadspectrum and multitargeted inhibitor development against ZIKV and other flaviviruses. author/funder.

" Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus transmitted by blood-feeding midges to a wide 27 range of wild and domestic ruminants. In this report, we showed that BTV, through its virulence 28 non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. In 29 response to growth factors, the MAPK/ERK pathway activates cell survival, differentiation, 30 proliferation and protein translation but can also lead to the production of several inflammatory 31 cytokines. By combining immunoprecipitation of BTV-NS3 and mass spectrometry analysis 32 from both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells, we identified the serine/threonine-protein 33 kinase B-Raf (BRAF), a crucial player of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a new cellular interactor 34 of BTV-NS3. BRAF silencing led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation by 35 BTV supporting a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate this signaling 36 cascade. Furthermore, the intrinsic ability of BTV-NS3 to bind BRAF and activate the 37 MAPK/ERK pathway is conserved throughout multiple serotypes/strains but appears to be 38 specific to BTV compared to other members of Orbivirus genus. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK 39 pathway with U0126 reduced viral titers, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its 40 own replication. Therefore, the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV-NS3 could 41 benefit to BTV replication by promoting its own viral protein synthesis but could also explain 42 the deleterious inflammation associated with tissue damages as already observed in severe cases 43 of BT disease. Altogether, our data provide molecular mechanisms to explain the role of BTV-44 NS3 as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis. 45 author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020.

" A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.4, 6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.",The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application
" The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.",Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole
" Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system that is targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",The role of post-Golgi transport pathways and sorting motifs in the plasmodesmal targeting of the movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV)
" Positive-sense RNA viruses hijack intracellular membranes that provide niches for viral RNA 23 synthesis and a platform for interactions with host proteins.

Notably, detection of 29 translation initiation factors at the RTC was instrumental to visualize and demonstrate active 30 translation proximal to replication complexes of several coronaviruses. 31 Collectively, we establish a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors 32 of unprecedented breadth. Our data may serve as a paradigm for other positive-strand RNA 33 viruses and provide a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of critical virus-host 34 interactions that represent targets for therapeutic intervention. Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate at membranous structures that accommodate the viral 37 replication complex and facilitate RNA synthesis in the cytosol of infected host cells (1-5). 38 Rewiring host endomembranes is hypothesized to provide a privileged microenvironment 39 physically separated from the cytosol, thereby ensuring adequate concentrations of 40 macromolecules for viral RNA synthesis, preventing recognition of replication intermediates 41 such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by cytosolic innate immune receptors (6, 7), and 42 providing a platform that facilitates molecular interactions with host cell proteins. 43 Ultrastructural studies have reported the origin, nature, and extent of membrane modifications 44 induced by coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae), which materialize as an 45 ER-derived network of interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted 46 membranes (CM) in perinuclear regions of infected cells to which the viral 47 replication/transcription complex (RTC) is anchored (4, 8, 9). The RTC is generated by 48 translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-49 proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed 50 non-structural proteins (nsps) 1-16. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not 51 considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell 52 translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (10-12). Although it has not yet been 53 formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor 54 multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, 55 exo-and endonuclease, and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (13-18). Many of these functions 56 have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-57 host interactions (19-23). In most cases phenotypes were described via loss-of-function 58 mutagenesis, however, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC 59 components with host cell factors remain largely unknown. 60 .

Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to 63 other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins 64 required for replication (29, 30). Some of these proteins were described in the context of 65 distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation 66 (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified 67 by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a 68 small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment. 69 To capture the full breadth of host cell proteins and cellular pathways that are spatially 70 associated with viral RTCs, we employed a proximity-based labeling approach involving a 71 promiscuous E. coli-derived biotin ligase (BirAR118G). BirAR118G biotinylates proximal (<10 72 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and 73 hence, does not rely on high affinity protein-protein interactions, but is able to permanently tag 74 transient interactions (31). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing 75 conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of 76 captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirAR118G as an integral 77 component of the RTC we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular 78 microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these 79 factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus 80 trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and 81 translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity 82 to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during 83 coronavirus replication.

This strategy was recently employed by 93 Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 (34). MHV-BirAR118G-94 nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirAR118G, while a deleted cleavage site 95 between BirAR118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein (Fig.  96   1a) . 97 MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 replicated to comparable peak titers and replication kinetics as the 98 parental wild-type MHV-A59 (Fig. 1b) . MHV-EGFP-nsp2, which was constructed in parallel 99 and contained the coding sequence of EGFP (34) instead of BirAR118G, was used as a control 100 and also reached wild-type virus peak titers, with slightly reduced viral titers at 9 hours post-101 infection (h.p.i.) compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 (Fig. 1b) . 102 To confirm the accommodation of BirAR118G within the viral RTC, MHV-A59-, MHV-103 BirAR118G-nsp2-, and mock-infected L929 fibroblasts were visualized using indirect 104 immunofluorescence microscopy. BirAR118G-nsp2 remained strongly associated with the MHV 105 RTC, as indicated by the co-localization of BirAR118G-nsp2 with established markers of the 106 MHV replicase, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8 ( Fig. 1c; Supplemental Fig. S1 ). This observation 107 corroborates previous studies demonstrating that nsp2, although not required for viral RNA 108 synthesis, co-localizes with other nsps of the coronaviral RTC (35-37).

Furthermore, to define the 113 localization of the nsp2 fusion protein at the ultrastructural level, we replaced the BirAR118G 114 biotin ligase with the APEX2 ascorbate peroxidase to generate recombinant MHV-APEX2-115 nsp2. APEX2 mediates the catalysis of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) into an insoluble 116 polymer that can be readily observed by electron microscopy (38). As shown in figure 1d , 117 APEX2-catalized DAB polymer deposition was readily detectable at characteristic coronavirus 118 replication compartments, such as DMVs and CM, categorically demonstrating that the nsp2 119 fusion proteins localize to known sites of coronavirus replication (4, 8). 120 Importantly, our collective results establish that the recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 121 replicates with comparable kinetics to wild-type MHV-A59, expresses a functional BirAR118G 122 biotin ligase that is tightly associated with the MHV RTC, and that biotinylated, RTC-proximal 123 proteins can be readily detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infected cells. 124 125 To further demonstrate the efficiency and specificity of BirAR118G-mediated biotinylation we 127 assessed, by western blot analysis, fractions of biotinylated proteins derived from MHV-A59-128 , MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-, or non-infected cells that were grown with or without the addition of 129 biotin (Fig. 2a,b) . A characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed 130 under all conditions where no exogenous biotin was added to the culture medium (Fig. 2b) . 131 The same pattern was detectable in non-infected and wild-type MHV-A59-infected cells when 132 the culture medium was supplemented with biotin, suggesting that the addition of biotin in the 133 .

In contrast, we observed a greatly increased fraction of 135 biotinylated proteins in lysates derived from MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells treated with 136 biotin. This result demonstrates that virus-mediated expression of the BirAR118G biotin ligase 137 results in efficient biotinylation when biotin is added to the culture medium. Moreover, we 138 could readily affinity purify, enrich, and recover the fraction of biotinylated proteins under 139 stringent denaturing lysis and washing conditions by using streptavidin-coupled magnetic 140 beads (Fig. 2b) . 141 Affinity purified proteins derived from biotin-treated MHV-A59-and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-142 infected cells were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (n=3). Liquid chromatography 143 tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from in-gel digested samples and log-144 transformed label free quantification (LFQ) levels were used to compare protein enrichment 145 between samples (Fig. 2c) . Overall, 1381 host proteins were identified, of which 513 were 146 statistically significantly enriched in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected samples over MHV-A59-147 infected samples. These host proteins represent a comprehensive repertoire of RTC-proximal 148 factors throughout MHV infection (Fig. 2c, table S1 ). Importantly, viral replicase gene 149 products nsp2-10 and nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein were significantly enriched in 150 fractions derived from MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells (Fig. 2c, d) . This is in agreement 151 with studies demonstrating co-localization and interactions amongst individual nsps, and with 152 studies showing association of the nucleocapsid protein with the coronavirus RTC (8,[39][40][41]. 153 It also highlights the specificity and effectiveness of the labeling approach in live cells and is 154 the first experimental evidence showing that collectively these viral nsps and the nucleocapsid 155 (N) protein are subunits of the coronavirus RTC. Furthermore, these results corroborate 156 previous reports that nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC (10-12, 157 42).

Accordingly, we 172 identified RTC-proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV 173 RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (rtn4; Fig. 2e ), and host proteins where co-localization 174 by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic 175 translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; Fig. 2e ). However, in the latter case, a more sensitive 176 detection technique, such as a proximity ligation assay that relies on proximity-dependent 177 antibody-coupled DNA probe amplification (43), demonstrated proximity of eIF3E and 178 dsRNA in MHV-infected cells (Fig. 2f) . 179 Collectively, our results show that the approach of integrating a promiscuous biotin ligase as 180 an integral subunit into a coronavirus RTC revealed a comprehensive list of host cell proteins 181 that comprises the RTC microenvironment. The efficacy and specificity of our approach is best 182 illustrated by the fact that we were able to identify all expected viral components of the MHV 183 .

" 12 Background 13 After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number 14 of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, 15 under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside 16 Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. 17 We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to 19 predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and 20 Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around 21 March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious 22 population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the 23 peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei 24 Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase 25 linearly. 26 The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global 28 outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 29",The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and
" Linear plasmids with almost identical compact genetic organization have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera. We employed pGKL1,2 plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate the previously unstudied transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. We performed 5' and 3' RACE analysis of all the pGKL1,2 mRNAs and found them not 3' polyadenylated and containing mostly uncapped 5' poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5' capping and/or 5' polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is controlled by the corresponding promoter regions. We refined the description of the pGKL1,2 promoters and found new alternative promoters of several genes. We also provide evidence that K2ORF3 encodes an mRNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase and that 5' capped pGKL1,2 transcripts contain N 7 -methylated caps. Translation of pGKL1,2 transcripts is enhanced in lsm1Δ and pab1Δ strains and is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. We suggested a model of a primitive regulation of pGKL1,2 plasmids gene expression where degree of 5' mRNA capping, degree of 5' non-template polyadenylation and presence of negative regulators as PAB1 and Lsm1 play an important role. Our data also suggest a close relationship between linear plasmids and poxviruses. doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 synthesized in a template-independent manner. We show that plasmid promoters directly determine the formation of the mRNA 5' end leaders and their capping, pointing to a possible role of the plasmid RNA polymerase in this unusual phenomenon. We also provide the first evidence that MTase is an essential part of the K2Orf3p enzyme and that capped pGKL mRNAs are methylated at the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine moiety. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that translation of plasmid-specific mRNAs is independent of major cellular cap-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the Pab1 and Lsm1 proteins that were speculated to be possible translational enhancers and/or stabilizers of cellular and viral mRNAs bearing 5' poly(A) stretches (38,39). Our results thus suggest the existence of a novel translation initiation mechanism. Materials and Methods K. lactis IFO1267 was transformed with a PCR-generated fragment consisting of 5' and 3' ends homologous to the part of the pGKL plasmid to be modified, a non-homologous part that introduces mutation/s into a plasmid-specific protein coding sequence, and a gene encoding a resistance marker (typically against G418 or hygromycin B) whose transcription is driven by the UCR of K1ORF1 or K1ORF2. This type of construct was prepared by fusion PCR; for the organization of such a construct, see Fig. 2A . After transformation, yeast cells were plated onto selective agar media, and their DNA content was analyzed for the presence of the modified pGKL plasmid using agarose electrophoresis. Both modified and wild-type target plasmids were usually detected after transformation. Colonies containing both the modified and wild-type target plasmids were selected and cultivated under selective conditions for approximately 60 generations and analyzed using agarose electrophoresis. For subsequent analysis, only colonies containing a modified version of the target plasmid were used. All constructs were verified using colony PCRs and subsequent sequencing of amplified products.",Messenger RNAs transcribed from yeast linear cytoplasmic plasmids possess unconventional 5' and 3' UTRs and suggest a novel mechanism of translation
" Cellular and viral factors participate in the replication cycle of rotavirus. We report that the 20 guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce 21 COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 22 3 IMPORTANCE 40 Rotavirus, a member of the family Reoviridae, is the major cause of severe diarrhea in 41 children and young animals worldwide. Despite the significant advances in the 42 characterization of the biology of this virus, the mechanisms involved in morphogenesis of 43 the virus particle are still poorly understood. In this work, we show that the guanine 44 nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, relevant for the COPI/Arf1-mediated cellular vesicular 45 transport, participates in the replication cycle of the virus, influencing the correct processing 46 of viral glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4, and the assembly of the virus surface proteins VP7 47 59 Rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, are non-enveloped particles formed by three 60 concentric layers of proteins that surround the eleven genome segments of double-stranded 61 RNA (dsRNA). The innermost layer is composed of the core-shell proteinVP2 that encloses 62 the replication intermediates, composed of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and 63 the guanylyl-methyl transferase, VP3. The intermediate layer is formed by VP6 that 64 surrounds the VP2 layer to form double-layered particles (DLPs). Finally, the addition of the 65 glycoprotein VP7 and the spike protein VP4 onto the DLPs forms the infectious triple-layered 66 particles (TLPs) (1, 2). 67 The replication of rotavirus occurs in cytoplasmic non-membranous electron-dense 68 inclusions termed viroplasms composed of NSP2, NSP5, VP1, VP2, VP6 and host 69 components (1, 3). The replication and packaging of the viral genome into newly synthesized 70 DLPs take place in these inclusions (4), which then bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic 71 reticulum (ER) through membrane sites modified by the presence of NSP4 (5, 6). NSP4 is a 72 transmembrane ER glycoprotein with two N-linked high mannose glycosylated chains (7) 73 that play a crucial role in the last steps of rotavirus assembly. It has been shown that the 74 cytoplasm oriented-terminus of NSP4 associates with VP4 (8), and binds the VP6 on DLPs 75 acting as a receptor for these particles to mediate their budding into the ER (9, 10). Moreover, 76 NSP4 has been shown to also interact with VP7 through its N-terminus oriented to the ER 77 lumen (11, 12). It has been proposed that these interactions drive the incorporation of the 78 outer layer proteins into the transitory lipid envelope that DLPs acquire during ER membrane 79 budding; this envelope is removed in the lumen of the ER by an unknown process in which 80 NSP4 is eliminated while VP4 and VP7 are assembled to produce the final infectious TLPs 81 All rights reserved.

Although the precise mechanism of the final steps of rotavirus assembly is not well 82 understood, it has been found that VP7 structure forms trimers on the surface of the virion in 83 a calcium-dependent process (15)(16)(17)(18). 84 Due to the high complexity of rotavirus replication, many of the cellular factors and 85 molecular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly characterized. However, it has 86 been recently reported that the coatomer protein I (COPI)/Arf1 machinery is essential for 87 virus replication since knocking-down by RNA interference (RNAi) the expression of some 88 of the proteins that integrate such machinery reduces virus replication (19, 20). Also, 89 brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of the COPI/Arf1-mediated vesicular transport, significantly 90 impairs the rotavirus progeny yield (21). COPI is a protein complex formed by seven subunits 91 (α, β, β´, δ, ε, γ and ζ-COP) that mediates the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi 92 apparatus to the ER (22-24). Besides its canonical functions in the secretory pathway, the 93 COPI/Arf1 machinery also may participate in the maturation of early endosomes and in 94 recycling proteins to the plasma membrane (25, 26), as well as in the maturation of 95 phagosomes (27, 28) and peroxisomes (29). Furthermore, multiple reports suggest that the 96 COPI/Arf1 machinery is also involved in transport events involved in the maturation and 97 function of lipid droplets (LDs) (30-32). In the initial step of the COPI transport, the small GTPase Arf1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) 99 is activated with a GTP molecule in a process catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange 100 factor GBF1 (Golgi-specific BFA resistance factor 1) located at the cis-Golgi membrane and 101 the intermediate ER-Golgi compartment (ERGIC) (33). The activated Arf1-GTP associates 102 with the Golgi membrane and promotes the recruitment of the preformed COPI complex as 103 well as of the Arf1-GTPase-activating protein (Arf1GAP).

" A novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019.

" Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute 24 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in 25 Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have 26 been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to 27 identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that 28 inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this 29 study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and 30 interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The 31 sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 32 compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to 33 interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that 34 SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies 35 used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein 36 and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the 37 binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by 38 antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may 39 have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that 40 F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

" In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance Statement We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5±3.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus group.",First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia

Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.

" Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients. Although several methods were performed in clinical practice, however, the IgM and IgG diagnostic value evaluation was little performed. 57 suspected COVID-19 infection patients were enrolled in our study. 24 patients with positive and 33 patients with negative nucleic acid test. The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298). AST in the COVID-19 IgM negative group showed significantly lower than the positive groups (P=0.0365). We provided a quick, simple, accurate aided detection method for the suspected patients and on-site screening in close contact with the population.",Clinical significance of IgM and IgG test for diagnosis of highly suspected COVID-19 infection
" The emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in China, 24 and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into 26 nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and 27 reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-28 coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-29 S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. 30 Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-31 S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and 32 SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease 33 pathogenesis.

" and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe case and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.",participated in study design
" The application of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to the structural characterization of transmembrane proteins (MPs) in detergent solutions has become a routine procedure at the most synchrotron BioSAXS beamlines around the world. SAXS provides overall parameters and low resolution shapes of solubilized MPs, but is also meaningfully employed in hybrid modeling procedures that combine scattering data with information provided by high-resolution techniques (eg. macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy). Structural modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation. We propose an automated pipeline integrated with the laboratory-information management system ISPyB, aimed at preliminary SAXS analysis and the first-step reconstruction of MPs in detergent solutions, in order to streamline high-throughput studies, especially at synchrotron beamlines. The pipeline queries an ISPyB database for available a priori information via dedicated services, estimates model-free SAXS parameters and generates preliminary models utilizing either ab initio, high-resolution-based, or mixed/hybrid methods. The results of the automated analysis can be inspected online using the standard ISPyB interface and the estimated modeling parameters may be utilized for further in-depth modeling beyond the pipeline. Examples of the pipeline results for the modelling of the tetrameric alpha-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 and mechanosensitive channel T2, solubilized by n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside are presented. We demonstrate how the increasing amount a priori information improves the model resolution and enables deeper insights into the molecular structure of protein-detergent complexes.

" The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020"
" Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported data from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared. In our baseline scenario, the government has taken strict prevention actions, and the estimate numbers fit the official numbers very well. Simulation results tells that, if the prevention measures are relaxed or the action starting date of prevention measures is later than Jan. 23, 2020, the peak of identified individuals would be greatly increased, and the elimination date also would be delayed. We estimate the reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.7. And simulation of the baseline scenario tells that, the peak infected individuals will be 49093 at Feb.16, 2020 and the epidemic spreading will be eliminated at the end of March 2020. The simulation results also tell that the quarantine rate and the starting date of intervention action policy have great effect on the epidemic spreading. Specifically, if the quarantine rate is reduced from 100% to less than 63%, which is the threshold of the quarantine rate to control the epidemic .

" 20 BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has 21 spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly 22 influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its 23 control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in 24 China. fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of 29 population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; 30 City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). 31 The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with 32 reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was 33 inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p <0.001) and infection rates (r =-0.4912, p <0.01). 34 Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r =-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure 35 rates (r = 0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. 36 CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily 37 to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and 38 adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved 39 prognosis of affected individuals. 40 41 .

" Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine 36 EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in 37 Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, 38 and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene 39 replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese 40 farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking 41 sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream 42 flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the 43 downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence 44 homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the 45 novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. Although the 46 phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, 47 type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins 48 for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G. 49 50",A novel defective recombinant porcine enterovirus G virus carrying a 2 porcine torovirus papain-like cysteine protease gene and a putative anti- 3 apoptosis gene in place of viral structural protein genes 4 5 6 Ryo Imai
" Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious 24 disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea that is characterized by severe hemorrhage and a 25 high fatality rate. Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this 26 disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-27 displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS 28 virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope 29 glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in 30 vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 31 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass 32 spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn 33 glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a 34 conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host 35 cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 36 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 37 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that 38 Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more 39 than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. 40 41",An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient potently 2 inhibits the infection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus
" Objective: HIV infection and aging are both associated with neurodegeneration. However, whether the aging process alone or other factors associated with advanced age account for the progression of neurodegeneration in the aging HIV-positive (HIV+) population remains unclear. Methods: HIV+ (n=70) and HIV-negative (HIV-, n=34) participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and metrics of microstructural properties were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs). A support vector regression model was trained on two independent datasets of healthy adults across the adult life-span (n=765, Cam-CAN = 588; UiO = 177) to predict participant age from DTI metrics, and applied to the HIV dataset. Predicted brain age gap (BAG) was computed as the difference between predicted age and chronological age, and statistically compared between HIV groups. Regressions assessed the relationship between BAG and HIV severity/medical comorbidities. Finally, correlation analyses tested for associations between BAG and cognitive performance. Results: BAG was significantly higher in the HIV+ group than the HIV-group F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001). HIV RNA viral load was significantly associated with BAG, particularly in older HIV+ individuals (R 2 = 0.29, F(7, 70) = 2.66, p = 0.021). Further, BAG was negatively correlated with domain-level cognitive function (learning: r = -0.26, p = 0.008; memory: r = -0.21, p = 0.034).",Title: An Augmented Aging Process in Brain White Matter in HIV
" The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.

To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients. 4 Structure-based antiviral drug design with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also been called ""3C-like protease"" (3CL pro ). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of 3CL pro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure superposition RMSDCα of 0.44 Å as shown in Figures S1 and S2. 3CL pro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs: 1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures; 5 2) 3CL pro is a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting 3CL pro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , lopinavir and ritonavir were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. 4 On the other hand, the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS as Figure S3 presents.

" The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular 9 response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our 10 understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host 11 responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We used microarray analysis 12 to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory 13 viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, 14 PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect 15 peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued 16 to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses 17 elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon 18 response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense 19 genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative 20 approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to 21 discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract. 22 42 murine cells. Because RV1B can replicate in mouse cells, it has been used to study immune responses and/or 43 mechanisms of asthma exacerbation in infected mice [1-5]. Intranasal inoculation of mice with a high dose of 44 RV1B results in viral replication and an early inflammatory response in the respiratory tract without clinical 45 signs of disease [1, 3-5]. RV1B antigens have been detected in cells of the epithelia and lamina propria of the 46 upper respiratory tract of infected mice [2, 4]. 47 MHV-1 is a strain of mouse hepatitis virus that preferentially replicates and causes disease in the 48 respiratory tract of specific mouse strains and thus serves as a model for respiratory coronaviral infections [6, 49 7]. MHV-1 causes severe disease in A/J-strain mice and milder pathology in other mouse strains [6, 8]. Mouse 50 strain-dependent disease severity corresponds to inflammatory responses, fibrin deposition, and reduced type I 51 interferon (IFN) production [6]. Further, type I IFN-mediated signaling is required for protection from severe 52 disease during MHV-1 infection of resistant mice [8]. MHV-1 has been detected in pulmonary macrophages of 53 infected mice, but has not been reported to infect respiratory epithelial cells in vivo [6]. Although primary 54 murine alveolar epithelial cells are susceptible to MHV-1 infection in vitro, their role during in vivo infection 55 is not clear [9].",Lung epithelial cells have virus-specific and shared gene expression responses 1 to infection by diverse respiratory viruses 2 3
" While the ecology of infectious disease is a rich field with decades worth of empirical evidence and theory, there are aspects that remain relatively under-examined. One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, and especially is cases where they are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. In this study, we develop an integrated, broadly applicable mathematical method to examine diseases fitting this description-the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted (W.A.I.T.) infection framework. To demonstrate its utility, we construct realistic models of two very different epidemic scenarios: cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water and hepatitis C virus in an urban setting of injection-drug users. Using these two exemplars, we find that the W.A.I.T. model fortifies the centrality of reservoir dynamics in the ""sit and wait"" infection strategy, and provides a way to simulate a diverse set of intervention strategies.",

" Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is 36 prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the 37 coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host 38 specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular 39 elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory 40 epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. 41 We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving 42 that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that 43 protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus 44 and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may 45 be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand 46 the differences in their zoonotic potential. : bioRxiv preprint Coronaviruses are the largest group within the order Nidovirales. Mainly, they cause 49 respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious 50 conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect 51 humans, four of which (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and 52 HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (SARS-53 CoV and MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and 54 multiorgan failure (1-6). Furthermore, in December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 55 emerged in Hubei province, China, causing pneumonia. To date, almost 90,000 cases were 56 identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide. 57 Coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (S) protein 58 and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. A number of adhesion 59 and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. For example, HCoV-229E (similar 60 to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as the primary entry port 61 (7). Surprisingly, its cousin HCoV-NL63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily 62 distant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8-63 11). HCoV-NL63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site (12-14). 64 A very different receptor is recognized by MERS-CoV, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 65 (DPP4) (9, 15, 16). Another betacoronavirus, HCoV-OC43, binds to N-acetyl-9-O-66 acetylneuraminic acid (17, 18). HCoV-HKU1 remains the great unknown because its cellular 67 receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed. 68 HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in 2004. The virus was present in a sample 69 obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia (19). Epidemiological studies show a 70 high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) and human 73 alveolar type II cells support the infection (22-25). A thorough study by Huang X et al. 74 demonstrated that HCoV-HKU1 binds to target cells via O-acetylated sialic acids on the cell 75 surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. The study also showed that 76 the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of HCoV-HKU1 exhibits sialate-O-acetylesterase 77 activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral 78 progeny (26). Bakkers et al. proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human 79 respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, HCoV-HKU1 lost the ability to bind to 80 attachment receptors via the HE protein (27). Recently, Hulswit et al. mapped the virus binding 81 site to O-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the S1 domain A is responsible for binding 82 to the attachment receptor (28). The S protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics 84 determine the host range. Coronaviral S proteins are class I fusion proteins comprising a large 85 N-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small C-terminal 86 endodomain. The ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of S1 and S2 domains. The globular S1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the 88 more conserved rod-like S2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which 89 brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. Such a structural switch may be 90 triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, 91 and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter 92 cells at different subcellular sites. Some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas 93 others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion 94 deep within the endosomal compartments (29-35). Furthermore, recent reports show that the 95 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. These differences may affect the 96 host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity (1). 97 Host proteases prime coronaviral S proteins. For example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in 98 the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (36), while a number 99 of coronaviruses from different genera (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, murine 100 hepatitis virus [MHV], MERS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) possess a furin 101 cleavage site (37-41). Kam et al. showed that SARS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by plasmin; 102 however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo (42). Cathepsins may also 103 act as S protein-activating enzymes. Indeed, cathepsin L processes the S proteins of SARS-104 CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MHV-2 (43-46). However, recent reports show that, in 105 vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the TMPRSS2 protease, which enables 106 endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process (45, 47-50). 107 While laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, S proteins of clinical isolates (e.g., 108 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) undergo TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface, 109 which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface (51). A recent study by 110 Shirato et al. demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally 111 permissive HAE cultures during cell culture adaptation because the S gene evolves and adjusts 112 to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells (51). 113 Here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (KLK) family as a new 114 player essential for HCoV-HKU1 entry to the target cell. The KLK family comprises 15 closely 115 related serine proteases with trypsin-or chymotrypsin-like specificity. The expression of these 116 enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique KLK expression profile. These 117 enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood 118 (52-56), and some have been linked to human cancers (57-60). The function of some KLKs 119 remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an 120 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient 123 in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. It is also of 124 importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help 125 to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential. 128 First, we asked whether HCoV-HKU1 infection modulates the expression of human 129 KLKs. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 or mock-inoculated. At 120 h post-130 inoculation (p.i.), cells were collected and the expression of mRNAs encoding KLKs was 131 analyzed. We detected the expression of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 in 132 non-infected fully differentiated cultures. However, the pattern in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells 133 was different: we detected an upregulation of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11 and KLK13. 134 Further, KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK9, KLK12 and KLK14 were expressed in the infected cells. 135 KLK2, KLK3, and KLK15 were not expressed (Fig. 1). 136 137 KLK13 is essential for HCoV-HKU1 infection 138 S protein priming is a prerequisite for coronavirus entry; therefore, we tested whether 139 KLKs take part in this process by culturing cells in the presence/absence of KLK inhibitors ( 140 Table 1 ) (61). For this, HAE cultures were pre-incubated with each inhibitor (10 µM) or with 141 vehicle control (DMSO) and mock-inoculated or inoculated with the virus (10 6 RNA copies per 142 ml) in the presence of the inhibitor. Apical washes were collected each day for analysis of virus 143 replication. Subsequently, viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed (RT), and the HCoV-144 HKU1 yield was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results showed that 145 HCoV-HKU1 replication was inhibited in the presence of a KLK13 inhibitor; this was not the 146 case for cells treated with DMSO or with inhibitors specific for KLK7 or KLK8 ( Fig. 2A) . 147 Next, we analyzed HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of a family-specific KLK 148 inhibitor SPINK6 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml (62, 63) or 100 µM camostat (a broad inhibitor 149 of serine proteases, also a potent inhibitor of KLK13) (34, 64).

" Translational control of memory processes is a tightly regulated process where the coordinated interaction and 47 modulation of translation factors provides a permissive environment for protein synthesis during memory 48 formation. Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-49 specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic 50 mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an 51 engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and 52 reversible phosphorylation of eIF2α causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo. Using this resource, 53 we discovered that temporally structured pan-neuronal protein synthesis is required for consolidation of long-54 term auditory threat memory. Targeted protein synthesis inhibition in CamK2α expressing glutamatergic 55 neurons in lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory, which was recovered with artificial chemogenetic 56 reactivation at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eIF2α in 57 CamK2α positive neurons in LA enhanced memory strength, but was accompanied with reduced memory 58 fidelity and behavior inflexibility. Our findings provide evidence for a finely tuned translation program during 59 consolidation of long-term threat memories. Memory is the capacity of an organism to encode, store, and retrieve information, and often guides the 83 action of the organism towards a better survival outcome. Aversive life-threatening events often lead to long-84 term associative memories between the environment in which those events were experienced in and the 85 threat, such that a salient cue from the event when presented again can elicit species-specific defensive 86 behaviors. Pavlovian cued threat conditioning is a useful experimental paradigm for understanding the 87 biological substrates of an associative threat memory, in which a neutral cue (e.g. light or tone) co-presented 88 with an innately aversive stimulus (e.g. air puff or footshock) elicits a defensive response such as freezing by a 89 repeat presentation by itself 1 . Cued threat conditioning is particularly amenable to studying memory 90 consolidation process because one-trial training is sufficient to form a persistent long-term memory and a 91 unimodal cue can be used for memory retrieval. Long-term aversive memories are thought to recruit a 92 distributed network of neurons across the brain, including subnuclei within amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, 93 as well as the neocortex, depending on the brain state, cue complexity, and the sensory pathways engaged 2, 3 . Lateral amygdala is the central sensory gateway for the amygdaloid complex and is crucially engaged both in 95 the processing and storage of the associative aversive memories 4, 5, 6 . Decades of studies have reported that consolidation of long-term memories requires one or more 98 waves of new protein synthesis after the memory is first encoded 7, 8, 9, 10 ; however, the use of pharmacological 99 protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI) in these studies is burdened with limitations. For instance, an extensively 100 used PSI, anisomycin, causes unwanted side effects that include superinduction of immediate early genes, 101 activation of stress signaling pathways, and catecholamine release 11, 12 . Pharmacological PSIs also do not 102 discriminate between molecularly heterogeneous cell populations and thus, do not allow manipulation of cell 103 autonomous protein synthesis. Genetic approaches to alter the translation machinery at the initiation step 104 provide less ambiguous evidence for the role of protein synthesis in memory processes 13, 14 . However 105 constitutive deletion of genes encoding translational control molecules lacks the temporal control needed to 106 convincingly interrogate the role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation. Past attempts at making 107 chemogenetic tools for blocking protein synthesis have had limited success 15 . A key regulatory step in mammalian protein synthesis is the assembly of active eIF2.GTP and initiator-110 methionyl tRNA into a ternary complex that binds the 40S ribosome. Various types of cellular stress engage 111 pathway-specific protein kinases that phosphorylate the α subunit of eIF2 on serine 51, which converts eIF2 112 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, a guanine exchange factor that promotes the conversion of 113 inactive eIF2.GDP to active eIF2.GTP. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2α stops the recycling of the ternary 114 complex and inhibits general translation 16 . However, phosphorylation of eIF2α also leads to a paradoxical 115 increase in gene-specific translation of transcripts harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) by 116 overcoming the inhibitory effects of uORFs on reinitiation at the putative start codon as ternary complexes 117 decline 17 . Dephosphorylation of eIF2α occurs during L-LTP as well as during consolidation and reconsolidation",Chemogenetic evidence that rapid neuronal de novo protein synthesis is 3 required for consolidation of long-term memory Introduction 82
" Here we present a novel protocol for the construction of saturation single-site-and massive multi-site-mutant libraries of a bacteriophage. We segmented the ΦX174 genome into 14 non-toxic and non-replicative fragments compatible with golden gate assembly. We next used nicking mutagenesis with oligonucleotides prepared from unamplified oligo pools with individual segments as templates to prepare near-comprehensive single-site mutagenesis libraries of genes encoding the F capsid protein (421 amino acids scanned) and G spike protein (172 amino acids scanned). Libraries possessed greater than 99% of all 11,860 programmed mutations. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete ΦX174 mutant genome and generate libraries of infective viruses. This protocol will enable reverse genetics experiments for studying viral evolution and, with some modifications, can be applied for engineering of therapeutically relevant bacteriophages with larger genomes.",Saturation mutagenesis genome engineering of infective ΦX174 bacteriophage via unamplified oligo pools and golden gate assembly
" Alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon in metazoans by which single genes are able to produce multiple isoforms of the gene product. However, this has been poorly characterised in apicomplexans, a major phylum of some of the most important global parasites. Efforts have been hampered by atypical transcriptomic features, such as the high AT content of Plasmodium RNA, but also the limitations of short read sequencing in deciphering complex splicing events. In this study, we utilised the long read direct RNA sequencing platform developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to survey the alternative splicing landscape of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. We find that while native RNA sequencing has a reduced throughput, it allows us to obtain full-length or near full-length transcripts with comparable quantification to Illumina sequencing. By comparing this data with available gene models, we find widespread alternative splicing, particular intron retention, in these parasites. Most of these transcripts contain premature stop codons, suggesting that in these parasites, alternative splicing represents a pathway to transcriptomic diversity, rather than expanding proteomic diversity. Moreover, alternative splicing rates are comparable between parasites, suggesting a shared splicing machinery, despite notable transcriptomic differences between the parasites. This work highlights a strategy in using long read sequencing to understand splicing events at the whole transcript level, and has implications in future interpretation of RNA-seq studies.",Direct nanopore sequencing of mRNA reveals landscape of transcript isoforms in apicomplexan parasites
" The use of metabolomics profiling to understand metabolism under different 20 physiological states has increased in recent years, which created the need for robust analytical 21 platforms. Here, we present a validated method for targeted and semi-quantitative analysis of 102 22 polar metabolites that covers major metabolic pathways from 24 classes in a single 17.5-min assay. The method has been optimized for a wide range of biological matrices from various organisms, 24 and involves automated sample preparation, and data processing using in-house developed R 25 package. To ensure reliability, the method was validated for accuracy, precision, selectivity, 26 specificity, linearity, recovery, and stability according to European Medicines Agency guidelines. We demonstrated excellent repeatability of the retention times (CV<4%), calibration curves 28 (R 2 ≥0.980) in their respective wide dynamic concentration ranges (CV<3%), and concentrations 29 (CV<25%) of quality control samples interspersed within 25 batches analyzed over a period of one- year. The robustness was demonstrated through high correlation between metabolite 31 concentrations measured using our method and NIST reference values (R 2 =0.967), including cross-32 platform comparability against the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQp180 kit (R 2 =0.975) and NMR analyses 33 (R 2 =0.884). We have shown that our method can be successfully applied in many biomedical 34 research fields and clinical trials, including epidemiological studies for biomarker discovery. In 35 summary, a thorough validation demonstrated that our method is reproducible, robust, reliable, 36 and suitable for metabolomics studies.",Validation and automation of a high-throughput multi-targeted method for semi-quantification of 2 endogenous metabolites from different biological matrices using tandem mass spectrometry 4
" The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B-and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development. : bioRxiv preprint Methods Primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein was retrieved from NCBI database using accession number MN908947.3 [3]. Experimentally known 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB)[1]. Protein sequence was analyzed for its chemicals and physical properties including GRAVY (Grand average of hydropathicity), half-life, molecular weight, stability index and amino acid atomic composition via an online tool Protparam [13]. TMHMM v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) was applied to examine the transmembrane topology of S protein. Secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein was analyzed by PSIPRED [14]. Existence of disulphide-bonds were examined through an online tool DIANNA v1.1 which uses trained neural system to make predictions [15]. Antigenicity of full-length S protein was evaluated by vaxijen v2.0 [16]. B-cell epitope prediction IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) [17] with default parameter settings were used to predict B-cell epitopes. Epitopes predicted by linear epitope prediction of Bepipred and Bepipred2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta turn, and Karplus and Schulz flexibility. BcePred [18] was also used to predict B-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and turns. Predicted B-cell epitopes by IEDB and BcePred were combined to the B-cell epitope candidate list. Based on transmembrane topology of S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, only epitopes on the outer surface were remained, and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. VaxiJen 2.0 [16] was applied to evaluate the antigenicity of the remained epitopes. A stringent criteria was used to have antigenicity score of 0.9 and 14 residue length epitopes viewed adequate to start a defensive immune reaction. A B-cell discontinuous epitope forms the antigen-binding interface through fragments scattered along the protein sequence. DiscoTope2.0[19] with discotope score threshold of -3.7 was used to predict discontinuous epitopes. Pymol was used to examine the positions of selected linear and discontinuous epitopes on the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein.",Epitope-based peptide vaccine design and target site characterization against novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2
" The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. The study was an observational, descriptive study. This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants patients diagnosed with COVID- The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury.

" Animal relocation data has recently become considerably more ubiquitous, finely structured (collection frequencies measured in minutes) and co-variate rich (physiology of individuals, environmental and landscape information, and accelerometer data). To better understand the impacts of ecological interactions, individual movement and disease on global change ecology, including wildlife management and conservation, it is important to have simulators that will provide demographic, movement, and epidemiology null models against which to compare patterns observed in empirical systems. Such models may then be used to develop quantitative narratives that enhance our intuition and understanding of the relationship between population structure and generative processes: in essence, along with empirical and experimental narratives, quantitative narratives are used to advance ecological epistemology. Here we describe a simulator that accounts for the influence of consumer-resource interactions, existence of social groups anchored around a central location, territoriality, group-switching behavior, and disease dynamics on population size. We use this simulator to develop new and reinforce existing quantitative narratives and point out areas for future study. The health and viability of species are of considerable concern to all nature lovers. Population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. Models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. So how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? We broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. We do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale [7], but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level [8] or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights. One of these methods is to build simulation 10 models that incorporate demographic, spatial, movement, and other relevant behavioral 11 and community processes, and then compare simulations of these models across various 12 scenarios [9] or outcomes with and without epidemiological processes added to the mix. 13 We take this latter approach and our primary aim is to develop a tool that can be used 14 to study the impact of disease on colonial populations and metapopulations [10] . This 15 tool must be comprehensive enough to include critical processes needed to address 16 questions that will extend our current knowledge in significant ways. Its application, of 17 course, is limited by the structure of the model. Thus, in building the model, we are 18 guided by principles related to concepts of ""appropriate complexity modeling"" [11, 12] . The standard approach to modeling disease outbreaks caused by 20 directly-transmitted pathogens is through systems of differential or difference equations 21 that model the number or density of susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered or 22 removed (R) individuals [13, 14]. These formulations may either be deterministic or 23 stochastic, and elaborated to include time-delays [15], demographic (births, deaths, and 24 recruitment [16]), metapopulation [17] and other spatial processes [18]. Examples of 25 these elaborations can be found in the context of modeling, inter alia, influenza [19, 20], 26 measles [21], SARS [22, 23], and Ebola [24-28] outbreaks. 27 Systems approaches to modeling disease limit our ability to consider individual-level 28 traits, unless these traits can be reasonably well expressed by dividing the population 29 into a limited number of subgroups, such as groups of individuals infected with different 30 strains of pathogens [29]. Including individual-level variation in disease models, however, 31 requires an agent-based approach [30], which then allows both individual behavior (e.g., 32 relevant to evaluating the probability of pathogen transmission) and pathogen exposure 33 history (e.g., relevant to evaluating the immunological state and hence the susceptibility 34 of an individual) to be incorporated into the model. It also allows one to trace the 35 number of individuals the each pathogen infects [25] and, hence, to identify individuals 36 that may be acting as super-spreaders [31]. Here, we develop an agent-based formulation that has application to studying 38 disease outbreaks in wildlife populations whose state of health-and hence, 39 susceptibility-is impacted by various factors, including social factors related to group 40 living and the structure of social networks [32], ecological factors related to foraging 41 success, and the movement behavior of individuals (which influences exposure to 42 pathogens). The model also includes a periodic return to a colony or nest cell, which 43 implies that the model has both a population-level and a group-association level (core 44 or household) structure. Such models have applications in animal production systems 45 (e.g., managing foot and mouth disease [33]), wildlife conservation [2], and disease 46 management at the human-animal interface [34]. The latter involves diseases such as 47 anthrax [35], bovine tuberculosis [36], and brucellosis in cattle and wild ungulates [37], 48 chronic wasting disease in deer [38], and toxoplasmosis in rats, cats and humans [39]. 49 Rather then following a formulaic ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Design 50 details; [30, 40]) or extended ODD [41] prescription in presenting our model, we take a 51 more expository approach by first crafting a broad outline of our model's general 52 October 1, 2019 2/28 All rights reserved.

In addition, to keep the paper reader-friendly, we relegate the mathematical 53 details of our model to a Technical Methods section at the end of the paper and the 54 algorithmic details to a supporting online file (SOF). In the Results section, we report 55 the results of simulations of several illustrative scenarios, and in the Discussion section 56 we present the findings in the form of a quantitative narrative that provides insights 57 into the role different processes play in creating the population patterns observed in our 58 simulations. At this point, a few brief remarks on quantitative narratives in disease ecology are in 60 order. Unlike the canonical theories of physics-with kinematics, electromagnetism, 61 general relativity, and quantum mechanics providing prime examples, ecology has no 62 fundamental theories and associated mathematical formulations that can be used to 63 develop an ecological epistemology. Rather, the complexity of the field induced by the 64 plethora of processes involved requires that we focus only on a limited number of these 65 processes when building models, where the selection of process depends on the questions 66 at hand [11]. Our understanding of these processes requires an analysis of associated 67 quantitative formulations, but the soundness of the arguments cannot be adjudicated by 68 comparing, say, the accuracy of Mercury's orbit as predicted by Newtonian versus 69 Einsteinian physics. Rather, ecological epistemology is woven from a collection of 70 quantitative narratives that provide current best explanations for, or fits to, observed 71 empirical and experimental data. While statistical null models are use to develop 72 consilient empirical and experimental narratives, dynamic null models are used to 73 develop quantitative narratives that are consilient with empirical and experimental 74 narratives (Fig. 1). Such dynamic null models have a Goldilocks quality in the sense of 75 containing just the right amount of biological process detail [42]: too little and model 76 simulations are rejected as providing adequate descriptions of observed data; too much 77 process detail and the null-model-parsimony principle, as discussed by Gotteli and 78 Graves ( [42], p. 6), is violated. 79 Fig 1. A sketch of the role of empirical, experimental and quantitative narratives in the formulation of canons and construction of syntheses in the development of an ecological epistemology. In ecology, quantitative narratives, derived from the Gause-Lotka-Volterra 80 competition model, were used to construct the concept of a niche [43]. This narrative 81 begins with insights into competitive exclusion [44, 45], supported by additional 82 quantitative ideas relating to niche breadth and overlap [46, 47]. In epidemiology, 83 quantitative narratives, derived from analyses of SEIR epidemic models (S: susceptible; 84 E: exposed but not yet infectious; I: infections; R: removed-that is, recovered with 85 immunity or dead) [13] , have been used to identify critical differences in the emergence 86 of outbreak thresholds depending on whether pathogen transmission is dependent on quantitative narratives in epidemiology that incorporate aspects of the movement of 89 individuals [50] or particular ecological processes have been used to develop canonical 90 theories [51][52][53][54][55]; however, these are limited in scope and generality by the analytical 91 difficulties of studying dynamical systems, as well as networks that include more than 92 one ecological or behavioral process. The challenge here is to keep the models somewhat 93 general and broadly applicable, while including several key processes such as: spatial 94 demography; consumer-resource ecology with associated reproduction, growth, stress, 95 and mortality processes; movement and contact behavior; and SEIR epidemiology, in 96 ways that are simple enough to interpret the effects of each process. Sensitivity analyses 97 provide one type of approach to separating out effects [56][57][58][59]. Another is to use 98 methods relating to the practice of appropriate complexity modeling [11, 12] . 2 Methods The model we present here only incorporates the focal processes of interest and those 101 needed to attain a level of realism required to adequately address the questions at hand. 102 Thus, for example, we do not include agent age structure in the model even though age 103 structure is known to have important effects on population growth patterns [60], 104 persistence [61], and epidemics [62]. Agent age structure would certainly add complexity 105 to our narratives; but, whether its impacts are critical (i.e., it qualitatively changes the 106 structures we explain) or only elaborative (i.e., has quantitative but not qualitative 107 implications regarding the questions asked) is a issue to be examined in future studies. 108 For clarity, we enumerate below-without mathematical details-the processes 109 incorporated in our model, leaving such details to the Technical Methods Section at the 110 end of the paper. Aspects of the Numerus Model Builder construction of the model and 111 the generated NovaScript (extended JavaScript language) implementation are provided 112 in a Supporting Information file. 113 2.1 Model Outline 114 The model is formulated as a set of agents (individuals) moving over a cellular array. The agents themselves can be differentiated with respect to type (e.g., sex), can undergo 116 discrete state transitions (e.g., disease state) and can also change continuously over time 117 with respect an agent-level state vector. In our case, the latter contains the variables 118 ""mass"" (also a surrogate for fitness) and ""stress"" (which accumulates when the individual 119 is unable to meet its resource needs each time period).

" Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma. DNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma. M.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients. Moreover, a fairly high rate of detection of mycoplasma is observed both in the cases when primers for RNA polymerase gene and primers for 16S-23S RNA were used. We found M.faucium in tumor tissues of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell. We assume that M.faucium can stimulate the mitogenes synthesis in breast tissues (e.g., cytokines) which, in turn, stimulate cell division and thus participate in the initiation of breast cancer.",MYCOPLASMA FAUCIUM AND BREAST CANCER
" The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.",Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques

" Most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin. Yet, while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two",Stochastic dynamics of an epidemics with recurrent spillovers from an endemic reservoir
" Coronavirus Disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.",Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses
" In December 2019, the first cases of a novel coronavirus infection were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.",Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design
" Article Summary: SARS-CoV-2 has similar replication kinetics to SARS-CoV, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type I interferon treatment. Abstract 1 SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 2 viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both 3 group 2B coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses 4 harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to 5 inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to 6 the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral 7 replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to 8 type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and 9 SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading 10 frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not 11 maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in 12 susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform 13 disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.",SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment
" Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single 21 pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the 24 presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses 25 (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, 26 ",Virome heterogeneity and connectivity in waterfowl and shorebird Running Title: Viromes of waterbird communities 4 5
" Delivery of native or chemically modified recombinant proteins into mammalian cells shows 31 promise for functional investigations and various technological applications, but concerns 32 that sub-cellular localization and functional integrity of delivered proteins may be affected 33 remain high. Here, we surveyed batch electroporation as a delivery tool for single 34 polypeptides and multi-subunit protein assemblies of kinetochores, a spatially confined and 35 well-studied subcellular structures. After electroporation in human cells, recombinant 36 fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes displayed native localization, 37 physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented 38 depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and 39 chromosome segregation. Farnesylation is required for kinetochore localization of the 40 Dynein adaptor Spindly. In cells with chronically inhibited farnesyl transferase activity, in 41 vitro farnesylation and electroporation reconstituted robust kinetochore localization of 42 Spindly. Thus, electroporation is uniquely versatile for delivering synthetic and, as required, 43 chemically modified functional mimics of endogenous proteins, and is therefore a promising 44 tool for chemical and synthetic biology.",Electroporated recombinant proteins as tools for in vivo functional
" The Arenaviridae is a large family of viruses causing both acute and persistent infections and causing significant public health concerns in afflicted regions. A ""trademark"" of infection is the quick and efficient immuno-suppression mediated in part by a 3'-5' RNA exonuclease domain (ExoN) of the Nucleoprotein (NP). Mopeia virus, the eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus, carries such ExoN domain, but does not suppress the host innate immunity. We have recently reported the crystal structure of the Mopeia virus ExoN domain, which presents a conserved fold and active site. In the present study, we show that the ExoN activity rules out a direct link between ExoN activity and alteration of the host innate immunity. We found that the Arenavirus ExoN, however, is able to excise mis-incorporated bases present at the 3'-end of double stranded RNA. ExoN(-) arenaviruses cultured in cells dampened in innate immunity still replicated in spite of a significant reduction in the viral charge over several passages. The remaining ExoN(-) virus population showed an increased base substitution rate on a narrow nucleotide spectrum, linking the ExoN activity to genome editing. Since, the Arenavirus ExoN belongs to the same nuclease family as that of the nsp14 coronavirus ExoN ; which has been recently shown to promote viral RNA synthesis proofreading; we propose that Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a ""limited RNA editing"" mechanism mainly controlled by structural constraints and a low mutational/fitness ratio.",Arenaviridae exoribonuclease presents genomic RNA edition capacity

" Odor memories are exceptionally robust and essential for animal survival. The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (""Fos-tagging""), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fostagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall. author/funder. All rights reserved.

" Cells of all mammals recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a foreign material. In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2',5'oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, IFNs of types I and III (IFN-β and IFN-). Our data suggests that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system. RNase L is a mammalian enzyme that can stop global protein synthesis during interferon response. Cells must balance the need to make interferons (which are proteins) with the risk to lose cell-wide translation due to RNase L. This balance can most simply be achieved if RNase L was activated late in the interferon response. However, we show by engineering a biosensor for the RNase L pathway, that on the contrary, RNase L activation precedes interferon synthesis. Further, translation of interferons evades the action of RNase L. Our data suggest that RNase L facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to specific needs of innate immune signaling. .
