0.0,0.2057,"medical, increase, effective, logistic, focus, network, hospital, research, treat, temporary","The outbreak of an epidemic disease may impose significant treats on human being and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to effectively control epidemic spread, a responsive logistics service is of vital importance. Over the years, researches have been focused on the establishment and the operations of temporary logistics network for delivering medical service and allocating emergency resources. However, the research focus has not been given to the design of a temporary reverse logistics network for medical waste treatment in epidemic outbreak, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk on both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper formulates a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreak, which aims at effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste and healthcare hazards within a very short period. The model is validated with a real-world case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even through the uncertainty of the future tendency of the COVID-19 spread is very high at the time of this research, some general managerial implications can still be obtained based on quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the computational results suggest installing and operating temporary incinerators at proper locations may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan."

Based on the number of reported cremations and on reports of possibly more accurate numbers on cases that appeared briefly on Tencent and were suppressed, we have conducted a modeling study to estimate the incidence and other parameters of the outbreak, including the potential starting time. The numbers for cumulative cases, new cases per day, and cumulative deaths coming from the non-official data are all substantially higher by a factor of 5 to 10 (depending on the date of the data) than would be implied by the official Chinese government data. All sets of non-official data used here imply that the coronavirus outbreak began in October or late September 2019."

The main manifestations of the patients were mainly upper respiratory symptoms, and some of the patients were accompanied by symptoms of the digestive system. There was no significant age limit for the infectivity of the population, but elderly people were still vulnerable groups. Patients with diabetes were more likely to develop into severe patients, and the probability of admission to the ICU was significantly increased."

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on best available evidence. We conducted a rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. 3166 papers were found and 24 included in the review. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Some suggested long-lasting effects. Where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine for no longer than necessary; provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.

We developed a novel and accurate method to quickly achieve COVID-19 diagnosis association indexes to improve confirmed diagnosis rate for clinical use."
8.0,0.339,"spread, country, global, risk, world, future, study, vulnerability, relationship, spatiotemporal","An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.

We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country’s vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.

Countries’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country’s vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries’ management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic."

The fatality is lower outside Hubei, a reflection of effective quarantine measures and medical care. The underestimated cases due to false-negative nucleic acid tests implies an actual lower fatality than the current estimation. The implication of broadened clinical diagnosis criteria in Hubei results in a sharp upswing in COVID-19 cases yet this could essentially counteract the underestimation of diagnosis and ensure prompt medical intervention to highly suspected cases. The interim gap in the knowledge of the actual dynamics of COVID-19 and heterogeneity of geographic differences need fulfilment by investigation on demographic characteristics and risk factors among population in various regions."

We use reported case data up to January 31, 2020 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission to parameterize the model. From the parameterized model we identify the number of unreported cases. We then use the model to project the epidemic forward with varying level of public health interventions. The model predictions emphasize the importance of major public health interventions in controlling 2019-nCov epidemics."

The confirmed infected individuals will still keep quick increasing for 14 days (approximately equal to the sum of exposed period and infection period) after the start time point of control. The strong prevention measures should be insisted until the epidemic Coronavirus. Other domestic places and overseas have confirmed infected individuals should take strong interventions immediately. Earlier strong prevention measures could efficiently stop the independent self-sustaining outbreaks in other cities globally.

Medical workers engaging in daily interaction with their fellow workers should be personally under effective protection against the infection. The health-care workers developing any possible associated symptoms should seek prompt medical attention and be duly isolated, thereby minimizing secondary transmission of 2019-nCoV in health-care associated outbreaks. Adequate protection against exposure to infected patients can effectively protect health-care workers from 2019-nCoV infection."
16.0,0.1961,"epidemic, china, hubei_province, february, predict, province, feb, total, expect, quickly","Since the first case of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, the virus has spread very rapidly in China on December 31st, with Hubei Province having the most severe epidemic situation. As of 24:00 on February 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province has reached up to 11,177. In this paper, we select the epidemic situation in Hubei Province as the research object to establish the SEIQDR model of infectious diseases. The parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. In comparison with Guangdong Province, where the SARS epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the SARS epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. But thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the SARS virus. The total number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from January 27th to February 10, and the epidemic will grow slowly after February 22nd. The growth is expected to stop on March 30th (ranges from March 26th to April 19th)."

The disease onset of imported 2019-nCoV infection was occult, and the clinical symptoms were usually mild, mostly presenting as low fever, fatigue, light cough, and mild dyspnea."
20.0,0.2364,"sar, cov, pangolin, human, analysis, illness, acid, accord, spread, ongoing","In the late December of 2019, an epidemic pneumonia (announced recently as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)) outbreak in city of Wuhan in China and widely spreads all over the world. According to authoritative statistics, the COVID-19 has caused more than 40,000 laboratory-confirmed infections with more than 1000 deaths by 12 February 2020 and is still increasing. It was caused by a novel identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV (renamed this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). Released complete genomes of 2019-nCoVs have helped rapid identification and diagnosis of the COVID-19. Currently, it is another key task to explore potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, which is vital to control COVID-19 spread. To this end, we re-investigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-like coronaviruses were detected by Liu et. By both deep assembly and multiple phylogenetic analyses, we found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, which would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV."

However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged."

However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV."
24.0,0.2619,"prevent, health, reduce, emergency, capacity, require, improve, exist, strengthen, manage","Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect and control outbreaks, which is underpinned by global variances in the strength of health systems to manage health emergencies. Half of all countries analysed in this study currently have in place operational readiness capacities which should enable an effective response to any potential health emergencies including 2019-nCoV. However, it is crucial to integrate/triangulate findings from local risk assessments to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to 2019-nCoV. Some countries may require external support if cases are identified and the infection spreads rapidly within their borders. As part of the commitment to the IHR (2005) countries should be implementing capacity building action to strengthen their ability to effectively prevent and manage health emergencies and the application of data analysis can support focused targeting of critical gaps that currently exist. Commitment to IHR (2005) also involves collaboration between States Parties to improve capacities for preventing and managing health emergencies which should also be carried out to improve preparedness. This will strengthen global readiness to contain existing outbreaks including the ongoing international spread of 2019-nCoV."

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry."

A total of 49 papers have been published in 20 journals during the last January and current February. These papers tried to explain the source of virus, the transmission route, genomic map and the similarity to previous viruses as well as the pathogenesis, symptoms and treatment methods. The huge numbers of the articles which were published on 2019-nCoV make confusing for the readers, since many of the articles are addressed similar topics. In this paper a systematic analysis was conducted for the published articles. The finding of these papers were summarized. Moreover, the present paper aim to highlight the responses of scientists and Journals for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. This paper reviewed 49 peer viewed articles while hundreds article still in the preprint. It was appeared that the Lancet journal has the highest numbers of publications (29%) which given an early alarm for 2019-nCoV. The first paper suggested Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease was published on 3 February in the Lancet Journal. In 16 January 2020, the genomic characteristics of the virus was published, followed by several papers on the diagnostic of the virus, pathogenicity and symptoms was more clear on 29 January. The Nature Journal was the fist which given an alarm for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In conclusion source of 2019-nCoV, treatment methods, as well as vaccines, pathogenicity of the virus in the patient with HIV or other virus infections, transmission to fetus in the pregnant women still need more investigation."

Some factories have resumed work since February 11, 2020, which exist the potential to cause the epidemic to increase again nationwide. In particular, because of the Spring Festival, more than 100 million migrant workers have to rework and 200 million school students at all levels might open the spring semesters. Consequently, its impact on the coronavirus epidemic block should be stressed. The publicity and supervision department should strengthen these two special groups’ epidemic learning and education, monitor their itinerary through a big data platform, and control their health and travel status in real time. It is recommended that migrant workers should not resume their work earlier than Feb. 27, 2020 and the school semester should also postpone to Apr. 1, 2020 at the earliest since large population density of students and their concentrated living and learning place."

It is important to know what has happened in this epidemic. We analyzed the epidemic curves of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 11, 2020. We found cumulative confirmed cases in this period increased in a fast speed in China. We also observed important disparities in cure ratio(%) and mortality across high-income and low-income areas. Finally, we observed important disparities in cure ratio (%) and mortality across seven regions.

The present review is primarily focused on the findings to indicate the role of ACE2 in the relationship between coronaviruses and influenza viruses with CV disease. It is postulated that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high, at least partly, due to high ACE2 expression in population with high CV risk. Coronaviruses and influenza viruses vaccine usage in high CV risk population could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronaviruses or influenza viruses infections."
